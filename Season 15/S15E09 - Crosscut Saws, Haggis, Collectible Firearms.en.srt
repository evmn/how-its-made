00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,788
narrator: chain saws and other machines may dominate forestry,     

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,056
but the human-powered crosscut saw          

5
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,393
still has a basic appeal.   

6
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,728
pushed and pulled through the trunks of trees,  

7
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,331
its jagged blade can handle any job,      

8
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,302
that is, until the person operating it runs out of gas. 

9
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,074
making a crosscut saw     

10
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:19,879
is an exact science that dates back centuries.   

11
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,213
at this factory,        

12
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,349
they make these saws the old-fashioned way,     

13
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,483
mostly by hand.        

14
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:25,818
it's a nod to a time      

15
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,021
when these saws were at the forefront of history,  

16
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,691
helping to clear the way for railways and settlements. 

17
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,626
with guillotine blades,    

18
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,628
a worker first trims a steel rectangle       

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,632
along the lines measured and marked onto it.      

20
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:42,034
the trimming gives it a distinctive taper      

21
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,704
and establishes the correct dimensions.    

22
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,440
this particular saw is a one-person model,     

23
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:50,242
so it's about 3 feet long.   

24
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,644
using a punch cutter,     

25
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,912
the worker carves gullets in the steel.         

26
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,181
these are the valleys between sawteeth,       

27
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,919
through which sawdust and debris are cleared.    

28
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,856
he cuts one gullet every inch. 

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,330
he then cuts the teeth, three between each gullet.   

30
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,671
this pattern is known as the great american tooth.  

31
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:21,006
it's designed to cut medium to hardwoods          

32
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,409
across the grain without snags.

33
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,548
he hammers each tooth to bend it

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,950
and alternates the direction of the bends --        

35
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,353
one up, the next down.     

36
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,956
this is called setting the teeth.       

37
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:45,898
and the result is protruding  
teeth that cut more efficiently.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,365
he files each tooth,      

39
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,035
working from the bottom up to the tips         

40
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,438
and sharpens those tips to a point.          

41
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,308
it takes about a half-hour   

42
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,478
to give this steel blank its crosscutting edge.     

43
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,318
a worker then connects the blade
to a power source.       

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,790
he centers a stencil of the company logo on the saw... 

45
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,791
and then applies liquid electrolyte       

46
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,461
to the exposed metal within the stencil.       

47
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,862
he turns on the power,     

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,798
and the electrolyte conducts the current          

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,566
to burn the logo into the metal.

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,804
a computerized router     

51
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,807
carves a piece of beech into the pistol-shaped handle. 

52
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,210
this software-driven tool   

53
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,779
also drills holes for installing the blade.   

54
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,818
the computerized system is quicker and more precise  

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,954
than manual carving.      

56
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:46,859
an employee then cuts a slot in the handle to fit the saw. 

57
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,868
he sands the edges of the handle
until it's smooth.       

58
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:02,908
he then inserts the crosscut saw blade into the handle.   

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,111
it's a tight fit,       
but to more solidly entrench it,

60
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,981
he drills through the holes in the wood handle       

61
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,515
to make corresponding holes  

62
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,852
in the metal blade sandwiched within it.     

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,660
he inserts screws into the handle,        

64
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,129
securing the blade to it.   

65
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,436
he tightens the screws as much as possible.      

66
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,514
and this one-person saw is now complete.        

67
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,885
a two-person crosscut saw is crescent-shaped and longer 

68
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,488
to cut through bigger trees.  

69
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,223
the teeth are also more substantial   

70
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,691
with deep pitches between them.

71
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:56,561
sawdust will be expelled through these deep pitches,  

72
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,598
so there's no need for gullets 
in this particular cutting edge.

73
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,102
once the teeth have been cut, 

74
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:08,573
a worker places socket fittings
on each end of the saw.    

75
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,178
he pounds in rivets to secure the fittings to the blade.   

76
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,646
these fittings will be used  

77
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,448
to install a different kind of handle known as a fist grip,

78
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,185
which is more suitable for a two-person saw.      

79
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,522
it's essentially a wooden dowel

80
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,593
that just slides into the socket fitting.    

81
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:32,664
it has taken about an hour to make this crosscut saw.   

82
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,466
wielded with force,      

83
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,069
it will cause mighty trees to fall,            

84
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:41,073
proving that this low-tech tool 
can still cut it on the jobsite.

85
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,222
narrator: haggis is scotland's national dish,   

86
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,959
made from minced lamb and beef,
encased in beef intestine.   

87
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,095
while quintessentially scottish,

88
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,563
historians believe haggis actually originated      

89
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,765
in ancient greece       

90
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,701
and eventually made its way northward           

91
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,569
with the romans to britain.  

92
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,109
haggis is traditionally served 

93
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,777
with mashed potatoes and turnips --         

94
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,046
what the scots call neeps and tatties --      

95
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,450
along with a glass of scotch whiskey to wash it down.

96
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,720
at the haggis factory,     

97
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,723
the production process begins with beef fat.         

98
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,593
they put it through a mechanical chopper,     

99
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,762
and a guillotine blade slices it up.         

100
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,003
the chunks of fat go into a large cook tank.   

101
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,006
they fill the tank with water 

102
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:49,208
and simmer the fat for 2 1/2 hours.        

103
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,615
then, using a strainer,    

104
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:00,886
they drain the cooked fat and put it in a tub.      

105
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,590
then they empty the tub into a mincer.         

106
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,829
next, they chop up lamb lungs. 

107
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:16,035
haggis recipes sometimes also use heart and liver.   

108
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,507
they simmer those in a cook tank, as well,    

109
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,275
for 2 1/2 hours.        

110
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,781
using a strainer,       

111
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,049
they drain and remove the cooked chopped lungs    

112
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,651
and transfer them to a tub.  

113
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,657
they now take dried, shredded onions     

114
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,392
and rehydrate them with some stock        

115
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,460
from the cooked meat.     

116
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,731
they pour the onion and stock mix         

117
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,868
into the tub with the cooked lungs...    

118
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,804
then empty the whole thing into the mincer        

119
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,806
to join the ground fat.    

120
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,282
next, two different grinds of oatmeal --         

121
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,884
medium and coarse --      

122
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,952
to give the haggis just the right texture --   

123
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,888
not too stiff, but not too loose.       

124
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,424
the consistency is key,    

125
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,426
which is why the grind proportions     

126
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,896
are a closely guarded company secret.        

127
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,832
also a top secret --      

128
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,235
the composition of the spice blend they now add. 

129
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,972
all the company will divulge about this seasoning      

130
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,174
is that it includes salt and pepper.          

131
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,176
the oatmeal and spice blend  

132
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,779
now join the other ingredients in the mincer,         

133
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,514
and there you have it --    

134
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,982
the finished haggis mix,    

135
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:40,652
ready to be stuffed into casings.         

136
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,055
in keeping with tradition,   

137
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:46,592
the company encases its haggis in beef intestines.      

138
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,193
after a thorough cleaning,   

139
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,395
the intestines are stored in salt.      

140
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,463
before use,          

141
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,666
they soak in cold water overnight to desalinate.    

142
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,402
this also softens them up   

143
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,471
until sufficiently pliable for the stuffing process.    

144
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,006
on the filling line,      

145
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,275
workers slip an intestine over 
what's called the stuffing horn.

146
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,812
then, with a knee, activate a lever        

147
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,280
that triggers the machine   

148
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,615
to pump out a set amount of haggis mix.         

149
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,619
on this run, they're preparing the one-pound size.      

150
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,489
they close the casing on either side         

151
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,491
with a thick aluminum staple. 

152
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,763
now they spread the haggis out on cooking trays        

153
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,766
and pierce each casing to let air escape       

154
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,102
as the casing shrinks during cooking.        

155
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,576
the temperature inside the steam oven     

156
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,113
is 230 degrees fahrenheit.   

157
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,114
the haggis cooks for one hour, 

158
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,918
during which the casing shrinks
and forms into a ball shape.  

159
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,788
once the haggis come out of the oven and cool, 

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,024
workers cut them apart.    

161
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,730
each haggis goes into a printed plastic bag,  

162
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,399
then into a vacuum sealer.   

163
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,937
the machine draws out 99.9% of the air        

164
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,539
before sealing the bag.    

165
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,674
this vacuum-packing process  

166
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:14,480
extends a 7-to-10 day shelf life
to 4 weeks.          

167
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:18,950
the packaged haggis now drop into a tank of hot water.   

168
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,021
the bags instantly shrink and thicken by 25%,      

169
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,691
making them significantly more durable.         

170
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:29,094
haggis may date back to ancient greece,       

171
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,696
but it's certainly changed with the times.        

172
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,967
this company also makes a   
one-minute microwavable version,

173
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:39,437
a canapé format, and even vegetarian haggis... 

174
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,774
far beyond what robert burns could ever have imagined.   

175
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,658
narrator: the term "collectible firearms"

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,126
refers to antique guns     

177
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,663
and top-of-the-line new guns made in the traditional style. 

178
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:08,133
these firearms are mostly handmade by skilled craftsmen, 

179
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,668
using centuries-old techniques.

180
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,005
this quality workmanship translates           

181
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,007
into top-notch performance.  

182
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,213
this company in england    

183
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,816
has been manufacturing rifles and shotguns since 1835.    

184
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,353
it still uses the same traditional gun-making methods,

185
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,688
only now with the help     

186
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,123
of modern-day computerized equipment.    

187
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,228
even with that technology, it's still arduous work.    

188
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,631
making just one gun takes, depending on the model,    

189
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,401
up to 1,250 hours of labor.  

190
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,173
in the factory's machine shop, under a shower of lubricant,  

191
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,308
a computer-guided tooling machine        

192
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,911
shapes a solid-steel bar into a hollow tube       

193
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,981
with a rectangular plate, called a lump, on one end.   

194
00:11:55,983 --> 00:12:00,452
this tube will become the barrel of a shotgun.    

195
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,923
here, you can see the progression        

196
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:05,991
from bar to tube,       

197
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,859
but it's still somewhat rough, 

198
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,262
so now a highly skilled barrel maker          

199
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,796
manually files the tube    

200
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,799
to obtain exactly the right roundness.  

201
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,270
this traditional process    
is known as striking the barrel.

202
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,939
with his expert eye, he checks his work       

203
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,876
by observing how light and shadows fall on the barrel.

204
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,213
now he lays two barrels side by side in a fixture   

205
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,849
and connects their lumps with pegs.           

206
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,288
he lays a strip of silver solder
along the joint        

207
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,124
and binds the adjoined lumps with steel wire.        

208
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,961
then he brushes on flux,    

209
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,830
a chemical which prevents steel
from oxidizing         

210
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,234
and helps molten solder flow into the joint.        

211
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,903
he now loads this end of the pair of barrels     

212
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,238
into a small furnace.     

213
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,707
within about 20 minutes, the fiery heat,        

214
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,910
peaking at a temperature of 1,650 degrees fahrenheit,  

215
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:02,180
melts the silver solder, which flows into the joint.  

216
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,783
the barrels are now bonded.  

217
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,919
next, he lays a thin strip of steel, called a rib,    

218
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,789
in the gap between the joined barrels.  

219
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,860
this time, he uses flux made of pine-tree resin,    

220
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,329
which works better than chemical
flux when soldering with tin. 

221
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:22,401
he immobilizes the rib with steel wedges and wire   

222
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,269
then, using a hand torch,   

223
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,572
melts tin solder to fix the rib
between the barrels.      

224
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,409
after removing the wire and wedges,      

225
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,947
he cleans off the flux and excess tin with abrasive paper,

226
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,950
revealing a seemingly seamless double barrel.         

227
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,288
now he mounts the double barrel
on a fixture          

228
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,023
and coats what's called a lapping rod         

229
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,226
with oil and an abrasive powder.    

230
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,430
he moves the rod back and forth
within the barrels       

231
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,231
until their inside is ground  

232
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,234
to within a fraction of an inch
of the required diameter.   

233
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,840
this process also smoothes the interior of the bore    

234
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,641
to a mirror-like finish.    

235
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:09,314
the barrel maker then polishes the outside surface to a shine.

236
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,316
meanwhile, the action body,  

237
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,485
the part that houses the gun's mechanics,      

238
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,987
has already been roughly shaped.

239
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,191
now the final machining in a bath of paraffin     

240
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,692
to wash away the metal debris. 

241
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,463
in a process called spark erosion,     

242
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,465
copper electrodes of varying shapes       

243
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,866
erode the steel        

244
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,603
to create the required slots, holes, and recesses.      

245
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,205
quite the transformation    

246
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,274
from what started out as a solid piece of steel.   

247
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,611
it's critical that the action's
60-plus intricate components  

248
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,680
will fit together with ultimate precision.    

249
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:46,151
once again, nothing beats the traditional method.    

250
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,953
the actioner blackens     
the component with a smoke lamp.

251
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,757
here, he's fitting the trigger plate.       

252
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,430
he positions it in the action, taps a few times...      

253
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,932
then removes it.        

254
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,570
the black soot marks left behind

255
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,840
indicate where the plate needs to be filed down.     

256
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,042
he repeats this procedure again and again        

257
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,179
until the plate fits perfectly.

258
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,514
he does this          

259
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,216
with each and every one of the action's components.  

260
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,719
using the same marking method, 

261
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,055
he also files the lumps on the barrel         

262
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,724
to fit to the action perfectly.

263
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,193
they hook onto a cross pin and serve as a hinge      

264
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,530
on which the barrel pivots against the action.      

265
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,202
he also marks and files the face of the barrel     

266
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,671
so that it fits perfectly with the face of the action.  

267
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,874
such flawless precision    

268
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:46,077
is the hallmark of top-of-the-line firearms.  

269
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,493
narrator: the shotgun's action is finished,          

270
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,962
but there are still two main components to come.  

271
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,163
the lock is the firing mechanism.     

272
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,766
the stock is the gun's wooden butt end   

273
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,036
that you steady against your shoulder to shoot.    

274
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,237
once those components join the others,        

275
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,440
the whole shotgun will be complete --      

276
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,108
lock, stock, and barrel.    

277
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,647
some double-barreled shotguns have two triggers --      

278
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,982
one per barrel.        

279
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,784
others have a single trigger  

280
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,452
which fires each barrel alternately.    

281
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,056
depending on the style of the gun,          

282
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,992
the two barrels are positioned either side by side      

283
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,660
or one over the other.     

284
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,195
the gun's firing mechanism is called the lock.      

285
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,331
a double-barreled gun has two locks --        

286
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,667
one for each barrel.      

287
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,537
each lock consists of a plate with 14 components.      

288
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,005
they've all been machined   

289
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,941
by the factory's computer-guided
tooling equipment.       

290
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,644
an expert craftsman assembles them by hand.    

291
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,546
to test the lock, he uses a cocking key     

292
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,882
to simulate what happens when you pull the trigger.   

293
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,219
the key depresses two     
spring-loaded sears that release

294
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,088
and drives a tumbler forward, 

295
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,290
striking a firing pin to fire the gun.        

296
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,894
the locks are installed on both sides of the action body, 

297
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:12,497
just above the trigger.    

298
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,566
in the factory's stocking shop,

299
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:18,036
another craftsman lays a template for the gun's stock 

300
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,971
onto a piece of turkish walnut,

301
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,440
traces, and then saws out the shape.  

302
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,512
the wood appears quite ordinary now,      

303
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,849
but wetting it a bit shows the rich grain,     

304
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,652
which an extensive finishing later on will bring out.    

305
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:44,329
just like the actioner before, he uses a smoke lamp      

306
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,398
to fit the action to the head of the stock,   

307
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,867
the soot marks telling him where to shave the wood    

308
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,201
with various chisels.     

309
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:54,005
this meticulous process takes more than 40 hours    

310
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,141
because he first has to strip the action of all its parts,  

311
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,544
then fit the main body into the stock,        

312
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,013
then reassemble the action piece by piece,        

313
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,950
fitting each and every one into the wood separately.    

314
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:10,622
now, using a tool called a drawknife,      

315
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,624
he finalizes the stock's shape.

316
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,028
by the time he finishes,    

317
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,699
the block of walnut has gone from this to this.  

318
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,503
a finishing specialist now applies linseed oil    

319
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,771
mixed with a hardener     

320
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,174
and polishes the wood many times over        

321
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,442
until the wood is lustrous.  

322
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,848
in the factory's engraving shop,

323
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,051
decorative work is underway on each lock plate.      

324
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,722
an engraving artist      
first draws the design on paper,

325
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,990
then on the plate in pencil.  

326
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,994
she then uses a sharp tool called a graver        

327
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,063
to cut the design into the metal plate.     

328
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:56,468
this process, while painstaking,
requires minimal pressure.   

329
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,004
the graver is made of either high-speed steel   

330
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,473
or tungsten carbide,      

331
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,076
extremely hard metals which cut into steel quite easily.  

332
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,881
later on, they'll highlight the engraving with black ink  

333
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,484
and varnish the surface to prevent tarnishing.     

334
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,089
now the action and lock plates 
undergo a heat-treatment process

335
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,824
that hardens the steel     

336
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,093
so that it won't wear out over time.           

337
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,296
this process leaves colors on the surface.        

338
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,032
on luxury guns like these,   

339
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:30,168
customers typically request designs or markings      

340
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,636
in gold inlay.         

341
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,506
after disassembling the barrels,

342
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:38,176
the craftsmen inlays, in this case, a barrel number. 

343
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,312
after cutting the number, he undercuts the edge of it  

344
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,182
so that the gold he then beats into the number 

345
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,050
will lock in place.      

346
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:52,590
then he files the gold inlay flush with the surface...   

347
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:56,828
and smoothes off the excess with an abrasive stone.    

348
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,137
every gun goes out to an independent authority  

349
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,806
for extensive firing tests.  

350
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,743
the gun returns certified with proof marks.       

351
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:15,613
the very last operation is a chemical treatment    

352
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,149
to protect the steel barrel from rusting.         

353
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,618
the steel reacts to this chemical process    

354
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,521
by turning from its natural silver color to black.     

355
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:30,361
because these guns are not mass-produced but handcrafted, 

356
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,896
with each and every component 

357
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,165
custom-fit to the neighboring component, 

358
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,366
parts from one gun       

359
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,302
are never interchangeable with those of another,     

360
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,705
even if they're the same model.

361
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:44,108
it takes approximately 1,000 working hours      

362
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,110
to produce a single gun,    

363
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,246
so customers placing an order 

364
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,217
typically wait at least a couple
of years until delivery.
