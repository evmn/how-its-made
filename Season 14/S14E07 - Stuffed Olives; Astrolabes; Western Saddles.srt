settles into each pocket.       

42
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,103
as the drum rotates, an olive   
settles into each pocket.       
this lines them up so that they 

43
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,838
settles into each pocket.       
this lines them up so that they 
exit the drum in a line onto

the conveyor that transports    
them to the pitting machine.    

46
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,445
the conveyor that transports    
them to the pitting machine.    
the machine pits 900 olives per 

47
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,080
them to the pitting machine.    
the machine pits 900 olives per

50
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,485
let's slow it down to show you  
what happens.                   
a coring knife enters one end of

the other end.                  
as the pit exits, it creates a  

54
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,631

as the pit exits, it creates a  
hole that's just the perfect    

55
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,400
as the pit exits, it creates a  
hole that's just the perfect    
size for the stuffing.          

56
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:52,765
next, a quality inspection.     
workers weed out any olives that
aren't perfect.                 

57
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:10,549

these beauties are being stuffed
with pickled garlic gloves.     

59
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,419
these beauties are being stuffed
with pickled garlic gloves.     
the stuffer cuts the cloves into

60
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,421
with pickled garlic gloves.     
the stuffer cuts the cloves into
hole-sized pieces, then inserts

00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,965
hole-sized pieces, then inserts 
one piece into each olive.      
it's the same procedure with

00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,933
latigo lace.                    
it ties both halves of the      
skirt together and will later be

401
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,702
it ties both halves of the      
skirt together and will later be
used to fasten the skirt to the 

402
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,571
skirt together and will later be
used to fasten the skirt to the 
saddle.                         

403
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,072
used to fasten the skirt to the 
saddle.                         
he pulls the lace under the     

404
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,242
saddle.                         
he pulls the lace under the     
weave to secure it.             

405
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:50,521
next, he applies a generous     
amount of glue to a leather     
stirrup cover.                  

406
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,256
amount of glue to a leather     
stirrup cover.                  
the stirrup is meat of oak,     

407
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,024
stirrup cover.                  
the stirrup is meat of oak,     
steamed into a "u" shape and    

408
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,993
the stirrup is meat of oak,     
steamed into a "u" shape and    
then reinforced with galvanized 

409
00:19:55,995 --> 00:20:00,331
steamed into a "u" shape and    
then reinforced with galvanized 
tin.                            

410
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,899
then reinforced with galvanized 
tin.                            
he presses leather into the     

411
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,134
tin.                            
he presses leather into the     
crook of the stirrup.           

412
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,736
he presses leather into the     
crook of the stirrup.           
then he bolts a metal spacer    

413
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:07,405
crook of the stirrup.           
then he bolts a metal spacer    
into the top.                   

414
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,074
then he bolts a metal spacer    
into the top.                   
now it's time to attach the     

415
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,176
into the top.                   
now it's time to attach the     
saddle skirts to the tree.      

416
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,011
now it's time to attach the     
saddle skirts to the tree.      
he threads cinch strings through

417
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,813
saddle skirts to the tree.      
he threads cinch strings through
the cinch keeper and nails it to

418
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:21,953
he threads cinch strings through
the cinch keeper and nails it to
the saddle.                     

419
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,155
another worker now rubs special 

420
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,290
oil into this western saddle to 

421
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,192
add color to the leather and    

422
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,094
preserve it.                    

423
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,928
the oiling also exposes the     

424
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,596
grain of the leather and        

425
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:38,837
highlights the engraved designs.

426
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,705
from start to finish, this      

427
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,440
western saddle has taken        

428
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,475
40 hours to make, but the modern

429
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,210
cowboy should get plenty of     

430
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,579
mileage out of it.
