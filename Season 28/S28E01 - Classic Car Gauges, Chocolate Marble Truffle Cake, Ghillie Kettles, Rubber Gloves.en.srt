00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,253
narrator: they may have stopped making the car.         

4
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,857
but they still manufacture replacement gauges        

5
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,259
that look just like the originals.       

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,661
after all, modern digital instruments    

7
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,796
just wouldn't look right     

8
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,632
in the dashboard of a classic vehicle.      

9
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,135
technicians give the mechanism a bit of an update,       

10
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,203
but the look is all retro.    

11
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,674
these car gauges are new.    

12
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,677
but they have the same old faces.       

13
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:21,813
the old-style dials are built to the original designs     

14
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,218
as replacement parts for classic and vintage vehicles.  

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,953
making a classic car gauge    

16
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,490
starts with a zinc-coated steel blank.    

17
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,092
a worker places the blank on a tool.       

18
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,295
a press stretches it around the form         

19
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,430
to shape it into the gauge case.              

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,167
after a flange has been formed on the rim    

21
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,769
and holes punched for assembly purposes,      

22
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,171
it's on to the next operation.  

23
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,241
a worker welds a stud to the back of the case.     

24
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:54,046
the stud will be used to mount the gauge to the dashboard.   

25
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,283
another worker paints the inside of the case white.  

26
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,723
next up is a brass tube for the light bulb.       

27
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:08,126
a worker secures it in a fixture and places the case over it.   

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,262
a press crimps the top of the light tube    

29
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,264
around one of the holes in the case,           

30
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:16,268
securing the tube to the back.  

31
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,803
a mechanized printer pad     

32
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,472
picks up ink from engravings on a metal plate         

33
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,708
and transfers them to a dial.  

34
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,015
for this gauge, they'll need a hollow, curved spring,     

35
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,951
known as a bourdon tube.     

36
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,688
to shape this flat brass tube into a spring,          

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,891
a worker tucks one end into a forming tool.       

38
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,826
he inserts a shim into the other end        

39
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,294
to keep the tube hollow     

40
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,297
as he curls it around the form.         

41
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,235
this turns the flat tube into a c-shape spring.      

42
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:54,573
he then crimps one end in this press.          

43
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,976
he dips the crimped end     
into a chemical cleaning agent  

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,578
and then into hot solder.    

45
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,513
the solder hardens        

46
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,116
and seals this end of the bourdon spring.      

47
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,054
he solders a brass adapter    

48
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,657
to the opened end of the bourdon tube.       

49
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,391
this hollow socket        

50
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,994
is the part that will receive the fluid pressure.       

51
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,198
that pressure will cause the tube to unwind        

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,268
and move gears that turn    
the pointer on the gauge dial.  

53
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,741
a worker places the tube in water        

54
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:33,212
and pumps pressurized air into it through the socket.   

55
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,082
he checks for bubbles that would indicate there's a leak.     

56
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,319
they make the gears that move the pointer      

57
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,622
using a hobbing machine.     

58
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,958
it's a spinning cutter that carves teeth        

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,162
into brass parts, known as racks.         

60
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:54,834
a worker inserts a brass pivot in a holding device.       

61
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,168
using a press,          

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,571
she crimps the pivot to the center of the rack.    

63
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,777
she then assembles a hair spring and a pinion    

64
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,779
between two brass plates.    

65
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,119
she positions the rack in the gear sandwich.      

66
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,558
she secures the assembly using a hand press.       

67
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,664
now, with tweezers, she pulls the end of the spring             

68
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,466
through a hole in one of the posts       

69
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,337
and locks it in place with a pin.           

70
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,005
she turns the shaft to confirm  

71
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:37,742
that the rack-and-pinion gears engage and work smoothly.    

72
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,212
returning to the bourdon tubes,      

73
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,281
she transfers one to a fixture  

74
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,883
and locks it in place.      

75
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,356
she places the gears on top of the bourdon tube    

76
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,058
and screws it to the side of the socket.    

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,363
she then installs the bourdon tube assembly    

78
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,266
in the gas gauge casing.     

79
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,906
a worker now connects the gauge              

80
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:10,376
to a pressurized air source.   

81
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,111
she pops the retro-look dial into the device         

82
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,581
and attaches the pointer to the protruding gear shaft.  

83
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,051
she then introduces air at a known pressure       

84
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,753
to calibrate the gauge.     

85
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:28,928
she tucks a gasket into the top rim         

86
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,530
and then fits a glass pane on top.       

87
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,737
a chrome-plated bezel retains the assembly and frames it.   

88
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,876
a press snaps the components together.     

89
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:52,217
made to measure, this car gauge is now complete,            

90
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,486
and it looks like a classic.   

91
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,367
93                

92
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,637
narrator: a chocolate truffle cake     

93
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,641
has nothing to do with those rare and pricey fungi              

94
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,176
that are a culinary delicacy,  

95
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,179
nor is it directly related to the chocolate truffle,    

96
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,449
a decadent confection consisting of a chocolate ganache center  

97
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,050
coated in either chocolate,   

98
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,753
cocoa powder, or toasted, chopped nuts.    

99
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,860
a chocolate truffle cake has many variations.       

100
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,128
this version features      

101
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,131
a flourless chocolate truffle cake base        

102
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,733
under a layer of chocolate marble cheesecake,           

103
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,769
garnished with fudge ganache.  

104
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,742
to make the cheesecake layer, they begin with cream cheese.  

105
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,811
they mix for three or four minutes to soften it,      

106
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,414
then blend in sugar and salt.  

107
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,685
next, they add sour cream    

108
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,888
to make the cheesecake creamier and fluffier.      

109
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,226
the last ingredients are whole eggs          

110
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,096
blended with vanilla extract.  

111
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:16,035
another three to four minutes of mixing completes the batter.             

112
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,036
to make the chocolate truffle cake base,            

113
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,641
they combine water, sugar, corn syrup, and cream of tartar,             

114
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,075
which is a leavening agent    

115
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,713
that works in flourless cakes like this one.          

116
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,048
it also prevents the sugar they just added    

117
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,917
from crystallizing.       

118
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,787
while heating those ingredients to a boil,      

119
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,655
they soften butter in a mixer,  

120
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,191
then add melted semisweet chocolate,       

121
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,361
which contains vanilla extract.            

122
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,999
they mix for another five minutes or so        

123
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,803
until the chocolate is thoroughly blended in.    

124
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,872
then they add the boiled ingredients,     

125
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,374
then coffee syrup...       

126
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,413
...then blended whole eggs.   

127
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,149
a final five minutes of mixing,     

128
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,487
and the chocolate truffle cake batter is ready.      

129
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,888
they pump it into        

130
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,157
the funnel-shaped feeder of a depositor.         

131
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,631
workers meanwhile line aluminum cake pans with silicone            

132
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,767
and place them on a conveyor belt.       

133
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,306
the depositor is set up to squirt            

134
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:30,642
exactly 28 ounces of the thick chocolate truffle cake batter  

135
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,178
into each pan.          

136
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,785
they pump the thinner cheesecake batter        

137
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,454
to the feeder of a second depositor,      

138
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,190
which squirts an identical amount of cheesecake batter   

139
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,392
into the pan.          

140
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,861
this batter is much lighter   

141
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,795
than the dense chocolate truffle cake batter.       

142
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,664
so rather than blend,      

143
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,067
the two batters form separate layers.         

144
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,538
using the squeeze bottle,    

145
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,374
they drizzle on some extra chocolate truffle cake batter  

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,147
and drag a knife back and forth,             

147
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,149
creating what's known in pastry making         

148
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,185
as a napoleon-style design.   

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,893
they put the pans in the oven  

150
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,497
for 90 minutes at 90 degrees fahrenheit.    

151
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,566
the long baking time at a relatively low temperature           

152
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,235
ensures the heat penetrates   

153
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,837
the dense truffle batter gradually.        

154
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,040
otherwise, the outside of the cake would burn      

155
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,342
before the inside is fully baked.         

156
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,181
the cakes cool at room temperature,       

157
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,516
then go into a freezer overnight.       

158
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,984
the next day, workers      

159
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,254
easily pop the rock-solid cakes from the pans          

160
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,724
thanks to that silicone liner.  

161
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:57,196
they place the cake on a cardboard circle,      

162
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,397
then, with a pastry bag,     

163
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,801
garnish the edge with fudge ganache.       

164
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,137
the ganache is made of heavy cream,         

165
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,606
corn syrup and the same melted chocolate         

166
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,441
they put in the truffle cake batter.           

167
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,480
they placed the finished chocolate marble truffle cake  

168
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:17,482
into an automatic cake slicer.  

169
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,019
the turntable rotates after each strike of the blade     

170
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:25,090
until the machine has cut the cake into 12 slices     

171
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,726
and separated them with paper dividers.       

172
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,031
they wrap the cake in a cardboard band       

173
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,000
printed with the brand name.   

174
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,908
then they put the dessert through a machine,        

175
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,710
which encases the cake in plastic film,         

176
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,280
then applies heat to shrink the film taut.     

177
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,054
to serve this decadent dessert,            

178
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,656
you let it defrost at room temperature       

179
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,391
for four to five hours      

180
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,126
or in the fridge overnight.   

181
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,395
impatient chocoholics take note --           

182
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,332
you can also defrost a slice in the microwave     

183
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,867
in just 30 seconds.       

184
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,814
187               

185
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,486
narrator: invented in the 1890s by irish fishermen,       

186
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,357
the ghillie kettle is still popular off the beaten path.   

187
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,293
simply stuff twigs, leaves or other scraps      

188
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,696
in the bottom chamber and ignite.           

189
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,299
the water in the surrounding chamber boils in minutes,    

190
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,367
allowing you to have a quick cuppa          

191
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,369
in the middle of nowhere.    

192
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,174
roughing it in the wilderness?        

193
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,109
with the ghillie kettle, you can still have        

194
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,779
a civilized cup of tea unplugged.            

195
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,586
making a ghillie kettle starts with a thick aluminum disk.   

196
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:05,457
a metalworker clamps the disk against a form in a lathe.    

197
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,991
as the lathe spins,       

198
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,562
he presses the disk to the form using a blunt tool.              

199
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,734
this transforms the disk into a flared vessel,      

200
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,737
one that looks like a flower pot.          

201
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,473
a cutter at the side trims the rim.          

202
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:25,210
they call this flower-pot shape the draft.            

203
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:29,881
the next phase takes the draft from flared to cylindrical.   

204
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,218
a worker presses the spinning draft to another form.      

205
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,689
this stretches the aluminum shape longer and narrower.    

206
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,158
finally, they taper the cylinder at the top            

207
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,826
to form a slanted chimney    

208
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,963
and slice off the bottom.    

209
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,165
from flat disk to a tall kettle,        

210
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,302
it's a dramatic change.     

211
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:54,439
he drills a hole        
in the gradient of the kettle.  

212
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:59,377
he inserts a screw that's attached to a punch.   

213
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,246
then, using an allen wrench,   

214
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,580
he turns the screw,       

215
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,249
forcing the punch into the metal              

216
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,885
to cut out a hole for the kettle spout.      

217
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,924
he now slides the kettle body over a post           

218
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,461
with a die that fits into the spout hole.       

219
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,565
he places the spout over the die and hammers it into the hole.  

220
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:24,135
the die helps form the seam as the metal spreads       

221
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,603
due to the impact,        

222
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,808
tightly locking the spout to the kettle body.       

223
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,477
a worker transfers the kettle to a jig       

224
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,613
with a template for drilling.  

225
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,547
he drills holes into the kettle body,         

226
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,352
relying on the template to space them correctly.     

227
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:43,889
these holes are for the handle and chain attachments.      

228
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,762
next, the inner wall of the ghillie kettle takes shape.             

229
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,330
wielding a tool with force,   

230
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,366
a worker pulls and stretches the aluminum disk        

231
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,035
into a long cone.        

232
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,444
he inserts the cone in the kettle body.       

233
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:08,179
a gap between them will serve as the water chamber.      

234
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,384
and smoke will be vented out the center.      

235
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,119
he rolls the upper lip of the cone    

236
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,854
around the kettle's top rim,   

237
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,591
locking them together.      

238
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,561
he also secures them at the base the same way.    

239
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,666
he transfers the ghillie kettle to a stand            

240
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,104
to keep it upright       
as he rivets steel ears to it.  

241
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,874
the ears are for attaching    

242
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,244
the handle and a chain for the kettle whistle.     

243
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,750
he now assembles the whistle.  

244
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,685
he aligns a gap in a round plate         

245
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,087
with one in the whistle body.  

246
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,493
this small gap will allow steam to pass through.         

247
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,629
he inserts a screw and     
a ball knob in the center hole  

248
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,633
to hold the whistle together.  

249
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,702
the base of the ghillie is this fire chamber.      

250
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,237
for packing purposes,      

251
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,709
he stacks it upside down    
and places the kettle over it.  

252
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,045
he wraps the entire kettle in british newsprint       

253
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,847
for shipping.          

254
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,315
this protects it         

255
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,717
and also gives the purchaser something to burn        

256
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,587
the first time he or she tries it out.     

257
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,925
he crimps the ends of the handle          

258
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,095
to the ears that protrude through the headlines.      

259
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,735
he places the whistle over the wrapped spout      

260
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,639
and then tucks the kettle into a drawstring tote.     

261
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,211
this ghillie kettle is ready to provide       

262
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,314
the convenience of hot water in the backwoods.        

263
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,085
the camper removes the whistle from the spout    

264
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,288
and pours water into it.     

265
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,226
this particular model can hold about 51 ounces.    

266
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,494
he replaces the whistle     

267
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:06,498
and lights the fire in the bottom chamber.      

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,767
as it burns,          
smoke comes out of the center.  

269
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,703
the cone-shaped cavity creates an upward draft,     

270
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,906
ensuring rapid boiling      

271
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:18,310
even in windy or damp weather.         

272
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,045
within minutes, there's hot water        

273
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,647
for beverages or soup noodles.         

274
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,982
smoking and whistling in the wilderness,        

275
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,386
the ghillie kettle offers some of the comforts of home.  

276
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,366
281               

277
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,938
narrator: it was an american nurse's   

278
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,275
that led to the development of medical rubber gloves.    

279
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,809
the year was 1890,        

280
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,080
and the hospital was johns hopkins in baltimore.           

281
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,215
sympathetic to the nurse's plight,      

282
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,350
the chief of surgery asked a rubber company      

283
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,120
to develop protective gloves.  

284
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,357
around the world,        

285
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,226
healing hands wear rubber gloves        

286
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,963
to stop the spread of germs and save lives.         

287
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,432
to make them, they need a lot of hands,    

288
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,769
the kind made from ceramic or aluminum.       

289
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,337
they'll serve as molds.     

290
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,508
first, they need to remove residue        

291
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,712
from the last rubber glove production.        

292
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,682
so they do a thorough washing in soapy water...    

293
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,456
...and then in bleach.      

294
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,992
they must remove every speck of residue      

295
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,860
because even the smallest contaminant     

296
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,396
could lodge in the latex rubber gloves    

297
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,199
and create holes.        

298
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,467
leaving the bleach,       

299
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:54,138
the ceramic hands twirl     
into round, revolving brushes.  

300
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,874
their bristles scour the surface        

301
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,278
and the hard-to-reach areas between the ceramic fingers.   

302
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,418
after this thorough scrubbing,  

303
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,654
the hand molds dive into a tub of hot water.     

304
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,693
it's the last cleaning before production begins.    

305
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,095
as they exit the tub,      

306
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,865
the hands swivel on the rail carrier to drip-dry.            

307
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,970
still slightly damp and spinning,          

308
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,106
the hand molds head into a chemical bath,      

309
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,509
which forms a film on the surface.         

310
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,844
it's a critical coating     

311
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,713
because liquid rubber won't adhere to bare ceramic,  

312
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,049
but it will to this substance.  

313
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,322
the ceramic molds now      
reach into warm liquid rubber,  

314
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,991
which has been enhanced for extra strength.       

315
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,794
the liquid rubber reacts with the chemical coating    

316
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,530
on the hands and becomes gel-like.      

317
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,803
coated with the rubber gel,   

318
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,606
the hands spin to shake off any drops      

319
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,108
as they head into an oven.    

320
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,147
under intense heat,       

321
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,083
the rubber dries to the hand form         

322
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,018
and also undergoes a chemical process,       

323
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,687
called vulcanization,      

324
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:20,891
that makes the rubber stronger and elastic.      

325
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,626
after a wash and dry,      

326
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,231
the gloves spin through brushes which roll up the cuffs.     

327
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,700
this cuff roll, called the bead,         

328
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,502
has a specific purpose --    

329
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,972
it makes it easier to pull   
the rubber glove off the mold.  

330
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,313
workers grab the gloves by the beads           

331
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,050
to peel them off the ceramic forms.        

332
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,719
these particular medical gloves             

333
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,921
were molded from synthetic rubber      

334
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,389
for people who can't wear natural latex rubber       

335
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,258
due to allergies.        

336
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,861
these synthetic rubber gloves are a bit stickier        

337
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,863
than the natural latex ones.   

338
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,166
and they must be removed by hand.         

339
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,337
however, the natural latex glove              

340
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,606
come off much more easily.    

341
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,275
bursts of pressurized air blow these gloves      

342
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,546
off the ceramic forms.      

343
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,081
at a test station, a worker now stretches      

344
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,216
and inflates each medical glove              

345
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,220
to check for weak spots and holes.            

346
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,490
even a pinhole leak would be cause for rejection.  

347
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,694
next, they take a sample glove          

348
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,030
from every batch and pump water into it,     

349
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,233
again checking for leaks.    

350
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,301
if the sample glove is watertight,          

351
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,405
they approve the entire batch for shipment.          

352
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,976
they color-code gloves for strength.          

353
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:49,981
these orange cleaning gloves are thick and reusable.     

354
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,583
others, like the medical gloves,     

355
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,952
are for limited use and disposable.         

356
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,056
each rubber formulation is customized          

357
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:01,659
for color, strength, and other characteristics.    

358
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,997
it has taken a lot of fake hands and real ones   

359
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,533
to make rubber gloves.      

360
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,001
and it all happens very fast.  

361
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,404
they manufacture 200 rubber gloves a minute    

362
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,606
at this factory.         

363
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,875
that's about 12,000 gloves per hour.            

364
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,344
they pack them up in batches of 100.        

365
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,614
a cornstarch solution applied earlier         

366
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,483
keeps them from sticking together in the box.       

367
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,419
later, that starch will also act as a lubricant   

368
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,490
to allow the gloves to slide easily onto hands.   

369
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,361
and with that, these rubber gloves are ready  

370
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,330
to protect the public.
