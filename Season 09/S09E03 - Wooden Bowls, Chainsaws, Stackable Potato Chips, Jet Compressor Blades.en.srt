chain saws...                   
stackable potato chips...       
and jet compressor blades.      

4
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,522
there was a time when bowl      
making was a cherished trade    
passed down through generations 

5
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,590
making was a cherished trade    
passed down through generations 
of woodworkers.                 

6
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,326
passed down through generations 
of woodworkers.                 
but today, with so much mass    

7
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,960
of woodworkers.                 
but today, with so much mass    
mass-produced tableware,        

8
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,795
but today, with so much mass    
mass-produced tableware,        
handcrafted wooden bowls have   

9
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,564
mass-produced tableware,        
handcrafted wooden bowls have   
become a specialty item, and    

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,400
handcrafted wooden bowls have   
become a specialty item, and    
this century's-old traditional  

11
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,336
become a specialty item, and    
this century's-old traditional  
craft is practically a lost art.

12
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:20,479
each of these exquisite bowls is
made from a solid piece of      
hardwood -- beech, maple,       

13
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,747
made from a solid piece of      
hardwood -- beech, maple,       
walnut, or cherry.              

14
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,683
hardwood -- beech, maple,       
walnut, or cherry.              
logs arrive at the bowl mill    

15
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,450
walnut, or cherry.              
logs arrive at the bowl mill    
fresh from the forest, so       

16
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,319
logs arrive at the bowl mill    
fresh from the forest, so       
they're still very damp, and    

17
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,621
fresh from the forest, so       
they're still very damp, and    
that's an advantage.            

18
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,623
they're still very damp, and    
that's an advantage.            
because the moisture lubricates 

19
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,890
that's an advantage.            
because the moisture lubricates 
the cutting tools.              

20
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,759
because the moisture lubricates 
the cutting tools.              
the first step is to divide the 

21
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,761
the cutting tools.              
the first step is to divide the 
log into blocks with a chain-saw

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,163
the first step is to divide the 
log into blocks with a chain-saw
operator measuring and          

23
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:42,401
log into blocks with a chain-saw
operator measuring and          
inspecting as he goes.          

24
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,735
operator measuring and          
inspecting as he goes.          
defects such as knots or        

25
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,337
inspecting as he goes.          
defects such as knots or        
scarring dictate the length of  

26
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:51,444
defects such as knots or        
scarring dictate the length of  
each block.                     

27
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,446
scarring dictate the length of  
each block.                     
any cracks or other flaws are   

28
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,514
each block.                     
any cracks or other flaws are   
marked with a red crayon.       

29
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,325
next, a rip-saw operator uses   
different size bowl patterns to 
determine the best way to cut   

30
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,060
different size bowl patterns to 
determine the best way to cut   
the block.                      

31
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,861
determine the best way to cut   
the block.                      
the goal is to get the biggest  

32
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,330
the block.                      
the goal is to get the biggest  
bowl-size pieces possible       

33
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,198
the goal is to get the biggest  
bowl-size pieces possible       
without including any defective 

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,034
bowl-size pieces possible       
without including any defective 
wood.                           

35
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,178
each bowl-sized piece is called 
a bowl blank.                   
this block is large enough to   

36
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,747
a bowl blank.                   
this block is large enough to   
yield three blanks, each of     

37
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,481
this block is large enough to   
yield three blanks, each of     
which will produce a 17-inch    

38
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,749
yield three blanks, each of     
which will produce a 17-inch    
bowl and a series of            

39
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,684
which will produce a 17-inch    
bowl and a series of            
progressively smaller bowls that

40
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,654
bowl and a series of            
progressively smaller bowls that
nest inside it.                 

41
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:49,234
the blank is mounted on to a    
woodworking lathe.              
from this point on, production  

42
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,836

from this point on, production  
is entirely dependent on the    

43
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,172
from this point on, production  
is entirely dependent on the    
lathe operator's skill.         

44
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,042
is entirely dependent on the    
lathe operator's skill.         
as the block spins, he carves   

45
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:58,176
lathe operator's skill.         
as the block spins, he carves   
out the bowls using a series of 

46
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,212
as the block spins, he carves   
out the bowls using a series of 
specialized knives designed and 

47
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,980
out the bowls using a series of 
specialized knives designed and 
forged at this very mill.       

48
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,216
specialized knives designed and 
forged at this very mill.       
first he uses this curved knife 

49
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,318
forged at this very mill.       
first he uses this curved knife 
to shear off the outer portion  

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,919
first he uses this curved knife 
to shear off the outer portion  
of wood.                        

51
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,754
to shear off the outer portion  
of wood.                        
it takes great expertise to know

52
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,389
of wood.                        
it takes great expertise to know
exactly how to angle the tool   

53
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,957
it takes great expertise to know
exactly how to angle the tool   
and when to pull it out and     

54
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,658
exactly how to angle the tool   
and when to pull it out and     
release the wood shavings and   

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,261
and when to pull it out and     
release the wood shavings and   
prevent a jam.                  

56
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,096
release the wood shavings and   
prevent a jam.                  
after two or three minutes, the

after two or three minutes, the 
exterior bark shell has been    

58
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,468
after two or three minutes, the 
exterior bark shell has been    
sheared off.                    

59
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,736
exterior bark shell has been    
sheared off.                    
the bare wood that's left       

60
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,170
sheared off.                    
the bare wood that's left       
represents the outside of the   

61
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,472
the bare wood that's left       
represents the outside of the   
largest bowl that he'll mill    

62
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:30,342
represents the outside of the   
largest bowl that he'll mill    
from this blank.                

63
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,944
largest bowl that he'll mill    
from this blank.                
with a finer blade, he sculpts  

64
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,412
from this blank.                
with a finer blade, he sculpts  
the wood to just the right      

65
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,913
with a finer blade, he sculpts  
the wood to just the right      
thickness and smooths the       

66
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,949
the wood to just the right      
thickness and smooths the

67
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,760
now he switches to a smaller    
curved knife and cuts into the  
wood.                           

68
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,695

wood.                           
this forms the inside of the    

69
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,831
wood.                           
this forms the inside of the    
largest bowl and the outside of 

70
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:57,169
this forms the inside of the    
largest bowl and the outside of 
the next smaller one.           

71
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,904
largest bowl and the outside of 
the next smaller one.           
the lathe worker repeats the    

72
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,672
the next smaller one.           
the lathe worker repeats the    
smoothing and cutting process   

73
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,174
the lathe worker repeats the    
smoothing and cutting process   
was progressively smaller

at a rate of about one a minute.
this one bowl blank produces    

77
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,916
at a rate of about one a minute.
this one bowl blank produces    
four nested bowls, the smallest 

78
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,784
this one bowl blank produces    
four nested bowls, the smallest 
measuring about nine inches in  

79
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:17,189
four nested bowls, the smallest 
measuring about nine inches in  
diameter.                       

80
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,924
measuring about nine inches in  
diameter.                       
the bowls are steamed for about 

81
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,526
diameter.                       
the bowls are steamed for about 
four hours to draw out the sap  

82
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,127
the bowls are steamed for about 
four hours to draw out the sap  
and hydrate the pores of the

once a bowl is dry, about a     
month later, workers even out   

86
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:36,675
once a bowl is dry, about a     
month later, workers even out   
the top rim on a sanding table. 

87
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,877
month later, workers even out   
the top rim on a sanding table. 
then, using a belt sander, they

speed.                          

391
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,901
engines are working at full     
speed.                          
inspectors examine the blades   

392
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,570
speed.                          
inspectors examine the blades   
under a black light.            

393
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,571
inspectors examine the blades   
under a black light.            
this one's perfect, but spots   

394
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,439
under a black light.            
this one's perfect, but spots   
of fluorescence on this one     

395
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,442
this one's perfect, but spots   
of fluorescence on this one     
indicate microscopic cracks and 

396
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,343
of fluorescence on this one     
indicate microscopic cracks and 
weaknesses.                     

397
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,047
this one gets rejected.         

398
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,916
the dovetail gets two strips of 

399
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,684
rubber silicone that ensure an  

400
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,453
airtight seal when the dovetail 

401
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,988
slides into the slot on the     

402
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:02,126
compressor drum.                

403
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,262
a final check, and the blades   

404
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,531
are now ready for takeoff.
