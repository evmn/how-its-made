00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:26,558
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,360
           balloons...          

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,066
         ...wallpaper...        

6
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,872
    ...frozen french fries...   

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,444
...and incandescent light bulbs.

8
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,320
        balloons are used       
    to mark special occasions   

9
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,323
     or to brighten up a day    
 for young and old people alike.

10
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,859
   but balloons weren't always  
         so delightful.         

11
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,929
 in earlier days, they were made
   of dried animal bladders --  

12
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,998
 a bit of an unpleasant concept.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,266
      in the 19th century,      

14
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,601
        someone invented        
        a rubber balloon        

15
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,470
    which we still use today.   

16
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,613
   they started mass-producing  
     balloons in the 1930s,     

17
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,949
  and today they're everywhere. 

18
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:31,690
 to make balloons, they pour dye
      into a tank of latex.     

19
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:37,229
     they filter it through     
cheesecloth to remove any lumps.

20
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,698
     agitators at the bottom    
           of the tank          

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,633
  mix it up for 15 or 16 hours. 

22
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,368
   this distributes the color,  

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,839
   and it also keeps the latex  
  active so it doesn't congeal. 

24
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,380
          balloons come         
     in 53 different shades.    

25
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,317
     nozzles spray hot water    
       onto balloon forms       

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,553
   to clean them as they move   
     on a system of rollers.    

27
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,062
      a fixture then flips      
       and dips the forms       

28
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,663
    into a tank of coagulate    

29
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,133
          that carries          
    an electrochemical charge   

30
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,735
       which will attract       
       the colored latex.       

31
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,143
     on top of this fixture     
        are balloon forms       

32
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,878
  freshly dipped in blue latex, 

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,015
           while below          
   a tank full of latex rises,  

34
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,684
       coating more forms       
       on the underside.        

35
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,968
          the job done,         
     the fixture flips back,    

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,171
    moving the balloon forms    
    to an upright position,     

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,042
   while below another tray of  
 balloon forms takes the plunge.

38
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,851
     the latex dries quickly    

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,788
       as a conveyor moves      
    the balloon forms forward   

40
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,323
    toward spiraling brushes.   

41
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,661
 the brushes roll up the bottoms
 of the balloons creating lips. 

42
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:19,197
 the lips will make it possible 
 for people to grip the balloons

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,566
    in order to inflate them.   

44
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,417
    the fixture flips again,    

45
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,552
   and the balloons nose-dive   
     into a hot-water bath.     

46
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,423
 they soak for up to 16 minutes.

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,690
     this step is critical.     

48
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,759
         it leaches out         
       all the impurities,      

49
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,363
       including a protein      
  that causes latex allergies.  

50
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:54,699
          the hot bath          
  also triggers vulcanization,  

51
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,768
    or rubberizes the latex.    

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,513
       the balloons travel      
       to another station.      

53
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:12,718
here, the fixture dips them in a
mix of talcum powder and water. 

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,621
 this will allow them to be more
  easily stripped off the form. 

55
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,301
 and now it's time for the forms
   to shed their latex skins.   

56
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,139
          as the forms          
   pass through this station,   

57
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,008
 air jets inflate the balloons. 

58
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,744
       rollers at the top       
       grab the balloons        

59
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:42,414
 as they fill with air and pull 
    them away from the forms.   

60
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,152
           the rollers          
   shoot the balloons upward,   

61
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,087
         and they topple        
      onto a conveyor belt.     

62
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,828
         next, a worker         
       piles the balloons       

63
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,364
       into an industrial       
         washing machine        

64
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,233
  and adds a cleaning solution. 

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,842
      the machine heats to      
a steamy 160 degrees fahrenheit,

66
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,045
    while the balloons tumble   
and nozzles spray water into it.

67
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,181
          this doesn't          
    just clean the balloons.    

68
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,051
 it completes the vulcanization 
          of the latex.         

69
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,190
now it's time to see if they can
  stand the test of inflation.  

70
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,526
    a machine blows air into    
  a huge, heart-shaped balloon, 

71
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,129
      and the heart swells      
       but doesn't break.       

72
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,271
  she holds it against a light  

73
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,541
   to check for imperfections   
         like blisters.         

74
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,076
 now it's time to blow some up. 

75
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,779
          they're sure          
    to brighten up your day.    

76
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,696
            narrator:           
   we've been using wallpaper   

77
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,098
    to add color to our homes   
        for a long time.        

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,702
 the use of wallpaper dates back
    to 15th-century england.    

79
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,438
      at first, it was seen     
      as a cheap substitute     

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,039
    for tapestry and panels.    

81
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,242
         but over time,         
 wallpaper gained wider appeal. 

82
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,511
           even today,          

83
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,447
     wallpaper is a popular     
   alternative to plain paint.  

84
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,921
    when it comes to variety    
           and design,          

85
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,290
      wallpaper has really      
         got it covered.        

86
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,059
             to make            
  the vinyl base for wallpaper, 

87
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,063
         they pour water        
    into a giant mixing bowl,   

88
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,633
     add stabilizing powder     
  and a lot of plastic pellets. 

89
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,276
        they add solvent        

90
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,746
   which helps to dissolve the  
  plastic pellets into the mix. 

91
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,884
   big beaters stir it all up.  

92
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,820
        it starts to look       
   a lot like pancake batter.   

93
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,289
         and just as if         
they were making pancake batter,

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,424
      they add ingredients      
        incrementally --        

95
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,827
      a little more powder      
      to thicken the mix...     

96
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,097
    and more plastic pellets    
        for good measure.       

97
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,568
          when the mix          
 reaches the right consistency, 

98
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,372
  they pour it between rollers  
 onto one side of special paper.

99
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:25,443
an applicator roller spreads the
vinyl mix evenly onto the paper.

100
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,781
    a jumbo reel rolls it up    
   and then unwinds it again.   

101
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,453
    here, nozzles fill trays    
           with paste.          

102
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,656
 rollers pick it up and apply it
  to the backside of the paper. 

103
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,258
  electrically powered rollers  

104
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,395
   pull the wallpaper through   
  a gas oven, drying the paste. 

105
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,865
   then they wind up the paper  
  again, creating a giant reel. 

106
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,468
   a circular blade now slices  
through the center of the paper.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,938
     this turns the one roll    
            into two,           

108
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,307
        each one of them        
       21 1/2 inches wide.      

109
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,418
  they pull off a sample piece  

110
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,888
     and tear the paper away    
         from the vinyl.        

111
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,489
  they're checking the adhesion 

112
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,658
        and if the vinyl        
     is durable and smooth.     

113
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,497
           meanwhile,           
 away from the production line, 

114
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,265
 stylists experiment with paint.

115
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,103
  they brush colors on a design 
     that they've selected.     

116
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,839
     they select five to six    
  different color combinations  

117
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,443
       because this design      
  will be printed in many hues. 

118
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,186
       each color requires      
    a separate print roller.    

119
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,590
     the design is engraved     
        into each roller.       

120
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,200
    a worker applies some ink   
 onto one of the print rollers. 

121
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,537
     as the wallpaper turns     
   on a big drum vinyl-side up  

122
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,407
   the print roller transfers   
   the image onto the paper.    

123
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,410
          each cylinder         
 layers it in a different color,

124
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,012
     building up the design.    

125
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,880
   darker colors are achieved   
      by deeper engravings      

126
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,282
      on the print cylinder     

127
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,152
 because they transfer more ink 
        to the wallpaper.       

128
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,522
conversely, shallower engravings
     produce lighter tones.     

129
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,840
 when they have the final proof,

130
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,109
         they compare it        
    to the original artwork.    

131
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,446
    if the colors look right,   
the design goes into production.

132
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,715
  there's no turning back now.  

133
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,851
        the ink is ready,       
   and the paper roll travels   

134
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,954
          through a web         
       of print cylinders.      

135
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,458
     here, print cylinders      
     build a dolphin design     

136
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,161
       onto the vinyl side      
          of the paper.         

137
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,866
         to dry the ink,        

138
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,803
        the paper travels       
  through a hot-blower system.  

139
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,805
  this is the view from below.  

140
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,083
        photos are taken        
     and viewed on a monitor    

141
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:21,552
   to get a close look at the   
 quality of the wallpaper print.

142
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,421
    if it passes inspection,    

143
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,024
     they roll the wallpaper    
        onto a big reel.        

144
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,296
         some wallpaper         
       has a flat finish,       

145
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,232
    but they often emboss it,   
     making raised designs.     

146
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,167
      this creates texture.     

147
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,040
   blades from above and below  
        cut the wallpaper       

148
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,943
      into 32.8-foot rolls.     

149
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,450
        a conveyor system       
    transports the wallpaper    

150
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,719
          to a machine          
      that shrink-wraps it,     

151
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,587
        and then it's off       
        to the showroom,        

152
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,523
       where you can pick       
      your favorite design.     

153
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,406
 narrator: most food historians 
      believe french fries      

154
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,675
          are actually          
      a belgian invention.      

155
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,212
 one theory says they originated
  in the 1680s with poor people 

156
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,082
 who'd resort to frying potatoes
        instead of fish.        

157
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,349
       during world war i,      

158
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,552
       fries were popular       
  with north american soldiers  

159
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,754
     stationed in belgium's     
     french-speaking areas,     

160
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,257
   which may be how they came   
   to be called french fries.   

161
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,835
  this company makes its frozen 
   fries from russet potatoes.  

162
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,171
        russets are oval,       
  so they produce longer fries  

163
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,240
      than a rounder-shaped     
         variety would.         

164
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,176
  russets are also sufficiently 
       crunchy when fried,      

165
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,779
            and their           
lower-than-average sugar content

166
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,115
        means their flesh       
       stays white longer.      

167
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,384
    when the potatoes arrive    
         at the factory,        

168
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,387
 they travel along rollers that 
 rub off any foreign matter --  

169
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,858
      things such as soil,      
  small rocks, and plant parts. 

170
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,394
           the rollers          
    also scrape off the eyes.   

171
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,999
          the potatoes          
 then enter the washing station.

172
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,001
          as they spin          
      in a revolving cage,      

173
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,004
 water jets spray their surface,
    cleaning them thoroughly.   

174
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:25,810
          next stop --          

175
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,347
 a sorting machine that divides 
      the potatoes by size.     

176
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:33,084
   it's made up of successive   
   levels of vibrating grids.   

177
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,886
           the shaking          
   forces the smaller potatoes  

178
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,087
   through the grid openings,   

179
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,623
         separating them        
    from the larger potatoes.   

180
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,826
  big potatoes become classic,  
       strip-shaped fries.      

181
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,730
  small ones become ring-shaped 
      or cube-shaped fries.     

182
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:06,151
after sorting, the potatoes drop
     into a collection bin.     

183
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,255
           once full,           
     its bottom hatch opens,    

184
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,124
     releasing the potatoes     
     into a giant steamer.      

185
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,260
     after about 10 seconds     
    in the pressurized steam,   

186
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,262
    the skins are soft enough   
           to come off          

187
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,664
  with just a little pressure.  

188
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,401
      that happens next in      
 this machine called the peeler.

189
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,469
          it looks like         
     a giant clothes dryer,     

190
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,772
      except that the drum      
     is lined with brushes.     

191
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,048
      as the drum tumbles,      
 the bristles rub off the skins.

192
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,958
    as the skinless potatoes    
        exit the peeler,        

193
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,426
      workers inspect them,     

194
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,162
   tossing any that have green  
         or rotten parts        

195
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,497
        or pieces of skin       
      still stuck to them.      

196
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,301
 the type of fries in production
 determines which of two systems

197
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,636
       to do the chopping.      

198
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:03,040
       a series of rotary,      
      mechanical slicers...     

199
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,110
     or a hydraulic system      
     in which running water     

200
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,047
      thrusts the potatoes      
     against cutting blades.    

201
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,657
  the freshly cut potato pieces 
       drop into a canal.       

202
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,193
  flowing water transports them 
       to a conveyor belt       

203
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,496
       that will move them      
    through the next phases.    

204
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,073
       now for a high-tech      
         quality check.         

205
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,875
      each and every piece      
       passes by a camera       

206
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,145
       in which a computer      
    analyzes size and color.    

207
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,414
    any substandard fry-to-be   
           is flagged,          

208
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,019
    and an air jet blows it     
    off the production line.    

209
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,754
         the good pieces        
     fall into a water tank.    

210
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,758
          as they soak,         
 sugar leaches out of the flesh 

211
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,828
so that they'll all turn out the
same color once they're cooked. 

212
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,231
         then a process         
      known as blanching --     

213
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,167
  the pieces go into hot water  
        then cold water.        

214
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,635
     this firms up the flesh    

215
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,338
   and makes the potato flavor  
        more pronounced.        

216
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,041
    then it's into the fryer.   

217
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,177
        the potatoes cook       
      for about two minutes     

218
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,281
       in non-hydrogenated      
         vegetable oil.         

219
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,318
       as the french fries      
        leave the fryer,        

220
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,656
 excess oil drains down through 
   holes in the conveyor belt   

221
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,324
   to a collection pan below.   

222
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:30,261
       the fries now pass       
    through the freezer area    

223
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,531
     which is between 5 and     
 negative-13 degrees fahrenheit.

224
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,200
            they take           
   about 10 minutes to freeze.  

225
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,403
          once they do,         

226
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,740
  an oscillating conveyor belt  
   deposits them into chutes.   

227
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:46,010
 each chute has a built-in scale
    set to the package weight   

228
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,746
 which, for this production run,
         is 8.8 pounds.         

229
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,483
 once that quantity accumulates,
 the bottom of the chute opens, 

230
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,386
       and the fries drop       
       into a plastic bag.      

231
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,892
 all the customer has to do is  
 drop these frozen french fries 

232
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,294
        into boiling oil        
    for two or three minutes,   

233
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,496
   and they're ready to serve.  

234
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,117
narrator: the incandescent light
bulb is a rather simple device. 

235
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,786
 its base has two metal contacts

236
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,654
          which connect         
      to a metal filament.      

237
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,390
the electric current's electrons

238
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,659
 collide with the atoms in the  
 filament, making them vibrate. 

239
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,063
  this energy heats the atoms   
  to 4,000 degrees fahrenheit,  

240
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,966
      at which temperature      
    they emit visible light.    

241
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,540
     the light-bulb factory     
    has two production lines    

242
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,275
     that eventually merge.     

243
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,610
  one prepares the glass bulb.  

244
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,745
         the other makes        
   what's called the mount --   

245
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,948
    the electrical components   
       that go inside it.       

246
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,350
 at the start of the mount line,

247
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,487
   a machine cuts glass tubing  
into pieces of specific lengths.

248
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:06,490
      the cut tubes land on     
  what's called a glazing wheel 

249
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,892
  that runs them through a gas  
 flame for about seven seconds. 

250
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,330
   this heats the glass enough  
     to smooth the surface.     

251
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,502
   the glazed tubes now enter   

252
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,837
          what's called         
     a flare-making machine,    

253
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,706
      which heats each tube     
  until the glass is malleable  

254
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,343
     then stretches one end     
      into a flared shape.      

255
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,452
        the next machine        
   loads two copper lead wires  

256
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,987
       into the flare end,      

257
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,388
         then it inserts        
     a thin, glass cylinder     

258
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,258
    called the exhaust tube.    

259
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,794
     a trip through a series    
 of progressively hotter flames 

260
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,995
       softens the tubes.       

261
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,465
      a press then moves in     
         to squash them,        

262
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,400
  encasing the wires in glass.  

263
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,802
        at the same time,       

264
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,071
the machine makes a tiny hole in
the glass in between the wires. 

265
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,407
   this is to later remove air  
      from inside the bulb.     

266
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,044
  it will exit via the exhaust  
     tube through this hole.    

267
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,550
   next, the machine separates  
         the lead wires         

268
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,618
 and forms the ends into hooks. 

269
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,292
  these fasten to the filament, 

270
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,961
        a thin wire coil        
        made of tungsten,       

271
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,565
         a type of metal        
   that holds up well to heat.  

272
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,432
the machine coats the lead wires

273
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,035
        in a liquid form        
   of another metal, zirconia.  

274
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,904
 this lengthens their life span 

275
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:30,274
  by making them more resistant 
  to moisture inside the bulb.  

276
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,578
 like the tubes we've just seen,

277
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,581
      the bulbs are made of     
  an inexpensive type of glass  

278
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,585
     called soda-lime glass.    

279
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,187
        a machine stamps        
      the top of each bulb      

280
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,456
 with the voltage, the wattage, 
      and the company logo.     

281
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,527
       opaque light bulbs       
     are simply clear bulbs     

282
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,996
     with an inside coating     
     of synthetic silica --     

283
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,265
         a white powder.        

284
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:58,735
   the coating machine charges  
   the bulbs to 30,000 volts.   

285
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,139
          combined with         
 just the right amount of heat, 

286
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,540
     this electrical charge     
  makes a thin layer of powder  

287
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,610
       cling to the glass.      

288
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,478
       a series of flames       
       evaporates moisture      

289
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,548
  and bakes off any impurities. 

290
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,423
           as the two           
     production lines merge,    

291
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,893
  a bulb goes over each mount.  

292
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,830
        torches then fuse       
   the flared end of the mount  

293
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,465
    to the neck of the bulb.    

294
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,435
 arms move in and mold the neck 

295
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,871
          to fit inside         
    the bulb's aluminum base.   

296
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,910
  the next machine vacuums out  
     all the air in the bulb    

297
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,913
         and replaces it        
   with pressurized argon gas.  

298
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,583
         this inert gas         
    will resist heat buildup,   

299
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,919
      helping the filament      
          last longer.          

300
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,391
  after bending the lead wires  
         out of the way,        

301
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,860
    torches melt and seal off   
     the glass exhaust tube,    

302
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,663
  locking the argon gas inside. 

303
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,931
      the bulb would now be     
        fully functional        

304
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,133
          if connected          
     to an electric current.    

305
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,936
       but it needs a base      

306
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,471
     in order to screw into     
 the socket of a light fixture. 

307
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,441
  the base is made of aluminum. 

308
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:17,348
      this machine inserts      
  one of the bulbs' lead wires  

309
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,751
       through the middle       
    and solders it in place.    

310
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,090
       it then spot-welds       
   the other wire to the side.  

311
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,359
          the result --         

312
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,562
  two base contacts to line up  
    with two socket contacts.   

313
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,705
   on their way to packaging,   

314
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,775
        the bulbs undergo       
 what's called flash testing -- 

315
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,045
    repeated light-ups, using   
   a higher voltage each time.  

316
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,247
        this strengthens        
      the filaments inside,     

317
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,150
      making it less likely     
    to break during shipping.   

318
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,255
          this factory          
   tests light bulbs regularly  

319
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,523
          to make sure          
  the light output and wattage  

320
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,392
    are what they should be.    

321
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:09,066
      one last illumination     
   to make sure nothing broke   

322
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,802
      between flash testing     
         and packaging.         

323
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,604
          the automated         
       packaging equipment      

324
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,273
     is designed to cushion     
  and protect the fragile bulbs 

325
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,543
       so they don't break      
        during transport.
