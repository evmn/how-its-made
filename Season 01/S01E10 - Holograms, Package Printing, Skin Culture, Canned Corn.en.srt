narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,894
...holograms --
projections for the future...

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,867
...package printing --
how to make an impression...

6
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,372
...skin culture --
it definitely grows on you...

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,245
...and canned corn --
we hope you're all ears.

8
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,421
holograms aren't just
beautiful and fascinating.

9
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,858
they have a certain
high-tech mystique about them.

10
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,862
well, stay tuned
to have the mystery revealed.

11
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,799
holograms are simply layered
variations of an image,

12
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,804
each one causing light
to reflect in a different way.

13
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,144
a hologram is
a 3-dimensional photograph

14
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,347
produced by the interference
of two laser beams.

15
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,682
a laser emits light --
this light ray.

16
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,086
the color of the light varies
according to the wavelength.

17
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,822
a shutter, when activated,

18
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,960
either blocks the light ray
or lets it pass through.

19
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:40,098
here the beam splits in two
at a 90-degree angle.

20
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,966
the interference
of the two beams

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,901
is clearly visible
on this screen.

22
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,970
it has very defined fringes.

23
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,973
the beams need great stability

24
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,708
because the pattern
of interference

25
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,444
projected on the screen

26
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,447
is extremely sensitive
to minute vibrations.

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,184
a light tap on the table
can easily spoil it completely.

28
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,456
the team will create a hologram

29
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,025
from this sculpture
made of modeling clay.

30
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,997
the sculpture is positioned
on a support

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,733
with a magnetic base that
adheres to the metallic table.

32
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,237
then they place a glass
in front of the object.

33
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,610
here's the exact point
where the light beam passes.

34
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,813
the table
has to be perfectly stable,

35
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,949
so it's made of
a 2.4-ton block of steel,

36
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,218
which rests on 18 air tubes.

37
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,886
the table and laser

38
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,190
are thus well-insulated
from all vibrations.

39
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,296
the beam splitter
separates the beam in two,

40
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,234
directing one behind the object
and the other in front of it.

41
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,838
one part of the beam

42
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,041
heads toward
the front of the sculpture.

43
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,244
the beam first passes through
an objective lens

44
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,845
that diffuses the light.

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,515
then it's reflected
by a parabolic mirror,

46
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,252
which prevents it from losing
too much of its intensity.

47
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,188
as in photography,
film is required.

48
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,991
this holographic film
is attached to a glass plate

49
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,793
with adhesive tape.

50
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,929
then another glass plate
is added

51
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,796
so that the film will not move.

52
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,402
a vibration of 1/10 of the
laser's wavelength is tolerable.

53
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,945
the laser is turned on.

54
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,250
the intensity of its light ray
reaches about 250 milliwatts.

55
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,223
the normal exposure time
of the model to the beam

56
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,691
is about one second,

57
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,561
but some holograms made
with a pulsed laser

58
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,764
are exposed to the light
for 12 nanoseconds,

59
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,699
an infinitely short
period of time.

60
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,701
here we see the reference beam

61
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,104
coming from
the parabolic mirror.

62
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,449
and here we see it
from another angle.

63
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,587
as in photography,
the film has to be developed.

64
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,523
these trays contain
different chemical solutions

65
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,925
and the developer.

66
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,994
first the film is soaked in
the developer for two minutes.

67
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,930
this solution blackens
the silver salts

68
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,133
that have reacted to the light.

69
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,935
then the film is soaked
in a solution called bleach

70
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,139
to completely eliminate the
silver salts that blackened it.

71
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,147
now the film is rinsed.

72
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,817
this step is used to eliminate
the acids in the emulsion

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,254
and so as not to contaminate
the next solution.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,628
the film
gently becomes transparent.

75
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,604
it's then rinsed in clear water.

76
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,509
and it's soaked for one minute
in a wetting agent

77
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,644
which eliminates
all water spots.

78
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,648
the film is then dried,
and it reveals its secrets,

79
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,085
and here's the hologram
created from the sculpture.

80
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:28,059
a hologram really creates
a 3-dimensional illusion.

81
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,127
some holograms can be animated.

82
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,597
they are generated from
a series of still holograms.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,932
depending on the complexity
of the project,

84
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:40,171
a hologram can be produced
from between one and five hours.

85
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,547
narrator:
your average product packaging

86
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,950
is crammed
with so much information,

87
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,885
it's hard to see the artistry

88
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,621
behind the instructions
and ingredients.

89
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,623
an incredible amount of thought

90
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,360
goes into making
packaging that's unique,

91
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,798
instantly identifiable,
and attractive to the consumer.

92
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,504
all consumer products
are packaged,

93
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,439
and the making of these packages

94
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:19,777
starts with the burning of
an aluminum plate like this one.

95
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,913
this animation illustrates
the burning process --

96
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,050
the transfer of an image
onto an aluminum plate.

97
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,186
the plate is placed
onto a cylinder,

98
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,390
and, using a laser,
the burning begins.

99
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,059
the image appears
in six minutes.

100
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,193
this plate will make

101
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,130
the printing impressions
on packages.

102
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,801
the laser that did the burning

103
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:48,139
has to be perfectly calibrated
using this test plate.

104
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,340
the plate is now ready
to make impressions

105
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,976
via the offset method.

106
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,947
printing involves ink,

107
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,283
and it requires selecting
the right one.

108
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:02,018
if the desired color
does not exist,

109
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,890
it has to be made up from
a mix of various other colors.

110
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,326
an ink trial
is done with a spatula,

111
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:14,098
and, using this small manual
press, color ink tests are done.

112
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,765
the ink is spread onto paper

113
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,503
and the color compared with the
one called for by the customer.

114
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,506
if the two match,
the presses can be started up.

115
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,042
this is a 6-color
offset process printing press

116
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,580
with a 28x43-inch capacity.

117
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,116
the press is fed by
a suction and friction process

118
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,387
devouring 8,000 sheets an hour.

119
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,990
now the printing plate is placed
onto the press cylinder.

120
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,928
this plate will contact inking
rollers of the ink reservoir.

121
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,662
to prevent it from drying,

122
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,732
ink viscosity is maintained
with this oscillator.

123
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,935
the press starts up
and reaches a production rate

124
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,739
of 8,000 impressions
in 60 minutes.

125
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:01,078
the press comprises
individual color printing units.

126
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,814
the paper sheet passes
from one unit to another,

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,016
receiving a new color
at each step.

128
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,084
here they register the colors --

129
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,088
that is, the quality
of the superimposition

130
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,023
of the different colors.

131
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,163
the final step is the folding
and gluing of the boxes.

132
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,432
this grooved plate

133
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,235
makes folding-point marks
on the carton.

134
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,971
and this machine does
the cutting, the embossing,

135
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,042
and stripping of the sheets
at a rate of 6,000 an hour.

136
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,713
the cutting die
cuts the carton sheets

137
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,718
and, together with the grooved
plate, makes the folding joints.

138
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,861
this sheet is slid
behind the cutting die

139
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,330
to equalize the cutting
of the sheets.

140
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,471
this enormous pile of 3,000
sheets is ready to be cut.

141
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,277
the embossing press feeder

142
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,348
handles between
6,000 and 8,000 sheets an hour.

143
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,852
rollers guide the sheets
in the direction of the press.

144
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,990
and here the sheets are embossed
by the machine.

145
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:27,565
the precision of the embossing
is then verified.

146
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,237
next comes the cutting
of the sheets.

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,441
they cut 8,000 an hour.

148
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,944
the cutting unit strips and
removes the unnecessary pieces,

149
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:46,283
and the carton scraps are sucked
up for eventual recycling.

150
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:53,657
the scraps can also be cut away
manually using a hammer.

151
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,394
the carton end pieces
are sent off for recycling.

152
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:06,070
all that remains is
the assembly of the packages.

153
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,005
this high-speed gluing unit

154
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,774
can make up to 30,000 to 40,000
per hour.

155
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,145
gluing begins with
the folding of sheets

156
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,947
following the folding marks.

157
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,818
the sides of the formed box
are then glued together.

158
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,287
an average of between
five to eight steps are needed

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,090
to fabricate a packaging box.

160
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:32,495
every day this plant produces
between 1 and 2 million boxes,

161
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,900
requiring almost 4,000 tons
of cardboard annually.

162
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,377
narrator: for people
who've suffered severe burns

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,112
there's hope.

164
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,182
they can be treated
with skin grafts

165
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,519
using human skin
that's been cultured in a lab.

166
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,121
patients
who receive these grafts

167
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,057
tend to develop less scarring

168
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,694
and usually heal
in a fraction of the time.

169
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,668
culturing of skin
allows us to save many lives.

170
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,871
to grow skin, epidermis cells
have to be isolated

171
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,807
and made to multiply.

172
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,409
it all begins with the removal
of a small skin sample.

173
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,545
the 10 million cells
in this piece

174
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,480
are enough to make a culture.

175
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,814
the skin soaks

176
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,085
in a medium containing
penicillin and gentamicin,

177
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,955
antibiotics which protect it
from bacterial infection.

178
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,623
now a piece of skin is cut

179
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,227
and delicately sectioned
on a petri dish with a scalpel.

180
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,097
the fat is gently detached
from the dermis

181
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,501
since it will not be needed
in the culturing.

182
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,571
the skin is cut into thin strips
because thermolysin,

183
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,774
the enzyme that separates
the dermis from the epidermis,

184
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,712
acts more efficiently
on the small surfaces.

185
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,914
then an enzyme
destroys the links

186
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,583
uniting the dermis
and the epidermis cells.

187
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,720
this procedure is carried out in
this incubator over three hours

188
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,656
at a temperature
of 98.6 degrees,

189
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,390
or body temperature.

190
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,326
once incubation is over,

191
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,029
the petri dish is removed
from the incubator.

192
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,803
only the epidermis cells,
also called "keratinocytes,"

193
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,271
are retained.

194
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:25,008
the epidermis is detached from
the dermis with great precision.

195
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,815
now the strips are placed
in a trypsination unit.

196
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,350
trypsin, an enzyme,

197
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,220
will destroy the links
uniting the epidermis cells

198
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,754
in order to isolate them.

199
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,690
this operation
signals the cells to multiply

200
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,360
now that they're
in a favorable medium.

201
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,163
in order to increase
the effectiveness of trypsin,

202
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,300
the trypsination unit
is placed on an agitator.

203
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,101
the cells do not have to remain

204
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,371
in extended contact
with the trypsin.

205
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,173
they're inhibited with
a medium containing serum.

206
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,843
then the liquid containing
the cells in suspension

207
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,179
is drawn off.

208
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,782
now the liquid is centrifuged
to obtain two fractions.

209
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,185
the base fraction containing
the desired cells

210
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,586
is at the bottom of the tube,

211
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,388
while the upper floating
fraction containing the trypsin

212
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:16,326
has to be removed.

213
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,830
this upper fraction is drawn off
with a vacuum system.

214
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,538
in order to eliminate
all traces of trypsin,

215
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,408
the culture medium is added
to the base fraction,

216
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,977
and the whole is put back
into suspension.

217
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,950
now the cells from the small
skin sample have to be counted

218
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,952
before being centrifuged
a second time.

219
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:49,092
the cells are counted
by hand using a microscope

220
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,161
or with this apparatus.

221
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,563
the exact number of cells

222
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,899
obtained during the extraction
via a biopsy is determined

223
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,235
as well as the number of cells
that will have to be seeded

224
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,737
for maximum growth.

225
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,646
the bottom portion
of keratinocytes

226
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,183
is divided in these flasks
containing a culture medium

227
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,686
whose composition
resembles that of blood.

228
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,591
the cells will multiply
over a week in these flasks,

229
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:26,462
placed in an oven at
98.6 degrees and at 8% oxygen.

230
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,132
the medium in which
the cells are immersed

231
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,834
is changed every two days.

232
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,206
in less than a week,

233
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,678
the cells have almost covered
the entire surface of the flask.

234
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,949
they can now be trypsinated anew
and thus reseed some 50 flasks,

235
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,953
which in turn will be placed
in the oven for about one week.

236
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,231
skin strips carpet
the inner surface of the flask.

237
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,301
they are then detached
with a spatula.

238
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,836
the flasks are cut in two

239
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,006
with a heating unit
resembling a soldering iron.

240
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:16,446
to make handling easier, gauze
is placed on the skin strips,

241
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,716
whose thickness is less than
1/10 of a millimeter.

242
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,855
the graft is placed
on the wound.

243
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,857
clamps and the gauze will be
removed after 10 days.

244
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,129
a patient can be skin-grafted
in less than two weeks.

245
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,338
narrator:
when it comes to vegetables,

246
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,608
there's nothing like
fresh corn on the cob.

247
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,576
but when that's not available,

248
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,212
corn is also great
right out of the can,

249
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:52,615
and anyone with an appetite
for feats of engineering

250
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,120
will appreciate the whirlwind
journey from cob to can.

251
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,496
throughout man's history,

252
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,232
food preserving has included
smoking, freezing,

253
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,301
drying, and salting.

254
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,038
in the early 19th century,
nicolas appert built a factory

255
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,508
to preserve foods in
hermetically sealed glass jars

256
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,911
and to sterilize them
by boiling.

257
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,980
but glass was breakable,
and so in 1810,

258
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,384
an englishman named durand
invented the tin can,

259
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,385
first used by the military,

260
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,024
and soldiers, it seems, first
developed a handy can opener.

261
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,935
the corn that's canned
is harvested

262
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,004
from mid-august
until mid-october.

263
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,739
canning is done very quickly.

264
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,273
less than four hours pass

265
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,875
between harvesting
and canning procedures

266
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,679
so as to conserve
much of the nutritional value

267
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,014
of the product to be sold.

268
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,485
the unloading of many trucks
of this size will be needed

269
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,691
for the 150,000 tons of corn
that are canned here annually.

270
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,497
the cobs are transported
into the plant on this conveyor.

271
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,266
they will first have to pass
through a kernel remover.

272
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,371
equipped with several
counter-rotating cylinders,

273
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,309
this unit removes the leaves and
the silk which surround the cob.

274
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,044
with only a few seconds,

275
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,514
the cob is completely stripped
of its covering.

276
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,783
once cleaned,
the cobs fall into this chute

277
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,520
en route to the next
processing step.

278
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,058
here they're lined up,

279
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,693
ready to be handled
by the kernel remover.

280
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,001
the kernels are removed
from the cobs

281
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:54,471
by going through the machine
where knives remove the kernels

282
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,072
in a fraction of a second.

283
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,677
each of these units remove
1.5 tons of kernels per hour.

284
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,813
twice a day the machines are
stopped to inspect the blades,

285
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,383
to clean, and sharpen them.

286
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,887
the corn kernels
fall into the middle

287
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,057
while the cobs themselves
are moved to the sides.

288
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,695
both kernels and cobs move along

289
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,031
on their separate ways
in the process.

290
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,968
the kernels are entered into
this rotating drum,

291
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,104
which removes any particles
larger than the kernels.

292
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,507
nothing is wasted
in the processing.

293
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,909
corn residues, leaves, and cobs

294
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,913
will all be used later
as animal feed.

295
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,983
now the kernels fall into
a mix composed of water

296
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,553
and of a fluid that's obtained
when cutting the corn kernels.

297
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,459
this liquid mix allows for
the transporting of the kernels

298
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,028
without damaging them.

299
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,267
next the kernels
flow along this belt

300
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,535
and are placed on this conveyor

301
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,671
toward the following
processing step.

302
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,744
bleaching is done
in this huge cylinder.

303
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:12,215
a worm screw brings the
bleached kernels to the surface.

304
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:16,419
a visual inspection verifies
the quality of the kernels.

305
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,561
all that remains is to pack them
into these leakproof cans.

306
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,429
thousands of cans of every size

307
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,732
are carried
to the filling department.

308
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:35,839
filling the cans is done from
this rotating filling machine.

309
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,443
this filling machine can handle
300 to 450 cans a minute.

310
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,716
the kernels
that fall to the side

311
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,852
are gathered up later
in this cylinder

312
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,654
and returned
to the filling line.

313
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,455
here a brine solution

314
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,458
composed of water, salt,
and sugar is added.

315
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,731
covers are securely attached
onto the containers,

316
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,067
but the canning
is not yet finished

317
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,637
because they have to proceed
with some very important tests.

318
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,543
they perform tests
in this laboratory

319
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,746
that assure the quality
of the product.

320
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,349
first they check the
watertightness of the cans.

321
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,484
they also control
the filling weight

322
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,520
and the quality of the kernels.

323
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,756
meanwhile,

324
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,426
cans continue winding their way
through the plant.

325
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,429
one step remains --
sterilization.

326
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,900
sterilization takes place
in this oven

327
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,703
at 250 degrees

328
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,505
and lasts
between 4 to 6 minutes.

329
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,773
this is a crucial step

330
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,776
because it guarantees
that the product is reliable

331
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,380
and that it will remain so
for 18 months.

332
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,516
now they taste
samples of the product

333
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,720
to determine that it conforms
to quality standards.

334
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,989
cans are labeled
as customers' orders are filled.

335
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,092
in this facility,

336
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:07,097
they produce an amazing total
of 43 million cans of corn.

337
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,671
