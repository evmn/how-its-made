narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:32,030
bicycle helmets -- letting
safety go to your head...

3
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:38,035
aluminum -- probably the most
versatile metal around...

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,172
car brakes --
we bring you breaking news

5
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,841
about how
they're manufactured...

6
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,109
and lithium batteries --

7
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,678
you'll get a charge
out of this one.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,653
if you're serious
about bike-riding,

9
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,522
you should also be serious
about safety,

10
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,991
and it all starts
with your head.

11
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,528
today's bike helmets meet all
the required safety standards

12
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,865
and come in a wide range
of colors and styles,

13
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,534
which means
you can protect your head

14
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,270
and look great doing it.

15
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,842
a bicycle helmet is constructed
of an exterior shell

16
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,678
and an interior one
of polystyrene foam

17
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,614
designed to absorb shocks.

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,750
some designs for bicycle helmets
are drawn by hand

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,953
and with
computer-aided graphics.

20
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,021
the design
has to take into account

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,823
that it is not on
a flat surface,

22
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,092
but on a rounded one.

23
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,662
this creates optical deformities
that have to be corrected.

24
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,572
fabrication begins
with the exterior shell.

25
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,309
this polymer sheet
is heated in a heat former

26
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,112
at a temperature
of 65 degrees centigrade.

27
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,780
the mold lifts the sheet

28
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,815
and suctions it to fill
all the cavities of the mold.

29
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,118
this operation lasts about
one minute

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,753
and produces four shells.

31
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,024
then, when cooled down
and hardened,

32
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,160
the four shells
are cut by hand.

33
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,669
ventilation openings are cut
with a heated wire apparatus.

34
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,005
these openings
have been preformed

35
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,740
during molding of the shell.

36
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,110
the heated wire easily
and neatly cuts the polymer.

37
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,352
next up, trimming the helmet
to eliminate excess polymer.

38
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,655
the circumference
is manually cut using a router.

39
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,864
the edges are then sanded
to even them.

40
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,503
it is also possible to cut
the circumference of the shell

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,772
with a heated wire.

42
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,774
this operation
takes more time,

43
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,244
but is more precise because
of the resulting cleaner cut.

44
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,056
now they're going to fabricate
the foam interior

45
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,193
that will be placed
inside the shell.

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,329
it's made
of polystyrene beads

47
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,798
that will expand
and bond together.

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,040
this expander increases
the volume of the granules

49
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,274
that fall into it.

50
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,942
steam and an agitator

51
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,212
let the polystyrene beads
expand uniformly.

52
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,148
the granules are now ready.

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,683
the contents of this bin

54
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,285
will be able to produce
about 20 foam pieces,

55
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,588
which will take shape
on these molds.

56
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,494
the press closes up for
the six minutes that it takes

57
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,296
to mold four foam pieces.

58
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,334
the particles fuse with steam
before being cooled with water.

59
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,103
the foam is removed
from the mold.

60
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,940
forms are produced
for different helmets.

61
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,712
fusing of the particles

62
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,915
has welded the granules
to one another.

63
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,717
depending on the helmet model,

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,252
openings have to be made
with this heat iron

65
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:20,324
to allow for installation
of an air-vent accessory.

66
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,526
all that remains is to make
the adjustment pads,

67
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,363
cut with
this press-powered stamper.

68
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,335
the adjustment pads
are held in with velcro

69
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,804
to allow easy adjustment
of the helmet.

70
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,540
this allows the cyclist
to change the foam pads

71
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,342
for greater comfort.

72
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,283
inserting the straps calls
for good manual dexterity

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,085
and takes only a minute.

74
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,230
the shell and the polystyrene
foam liner have to be joined.

75
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,832
they're adjusted
one inside the other,

76
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,368
then solidly secured
with adhesive tape.

77
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,737
the helmet is now completed.

78
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,775
and now it's ready
for packaging.

79
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,045
the safety helmets
have to be certified,

80
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,314
guaranteeing their safety,
and conformity tests are done.

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,985
at least one helmet in 500 will
undergo this destructive test.

82
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,790
here, it drops vertically
onto a piece of steel.

83
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,800
this facility can produce
up to 4,000 helmets daily

84
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,837
in hundreds of models
and over 500 variations.

85
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,081
narrator: take a look around,

86
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,950
and you'll find
this wonder metal everywhere,

87
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,287
in everything from screen doors
to jet planes.

88
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,689
aluminum
has so many applications

89
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,825
because it's light and strong,

90
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,694
and it's corrosion-
and crack-resistant.

91
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,832
producing aluminum is costly,
but it saves money over time.

92
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,105
aluminum --
so widely used today,

93
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,774
and the world's
most abundant metallic element,

94
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,043
does not occur
in a natural state.

95
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,613
the most available source
of aluminum is actually bauxite.

96
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:29,987
bauxite is mainly mined
in tropical countries.

97
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,924
the aluminum atom in bauxite
is bonded to oxygen molecules.

98
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,994
these bonds have to be broken
by electrolysis

99
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,730
to produce pure aluminum.

100
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,066
bauxite is carried by rail
to the plant,

101
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,334
where it will be crushed.

102
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,602
then, through
a chemical transformation

103
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,006
called the bayer process,
alumina is extracted.

104
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,342
this is then roasted
in calciners

105
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,944
to eliminate all moisture.

106
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,547
this is
the reduction facility.

107
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,084
this plant has 432 pots

108
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,954
through which a powerful
electric current will be passed

109
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,290
to produce electrolysis.

110
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,163
an overhead crane
dumps alumina into the pots.

111
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,099
then the electric current
from the anode

112
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,633
passes through the alumina

113
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,537
that we see here
at the bottom of the pot.

114
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:31,048
via the process of alumina
reduction at 1,742 degrees,

115
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,985
the anodes lose volume
and will have to be replaced.

116
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,987
it's a continuous operation.

117
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,357
each anode has a life-span
of about 20 days.

118
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:48,465
spent anodes are recovered from
the pot with this overhead crane

119
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,534
and carried off to be recycled.

120
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,216
they clean the aluminum rods,
which will then be reused.

121
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,958
here we see the crust formed
atop the anode.

122
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,960
when the anodes are replaced,

123
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,696
the accumulated impurities
have to be recovered

124
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,031
from the top of the pots.

125
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,701
this is accomplished
with these pincers.

126
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,770
then a new anode is inserted
into the alumina,

127
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,373
and electrolysis continues.

128
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,312
the electric current
breaks the molecular bonds.

129
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,181
the heavier aluminum collects
at the bottom of the pot,

130
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,585
while the oxygen bound to
fluorine is released as a gas,

131
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,621
which is drawn off
and treated.

132
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,728
the liquefied aluminum remains
at the bottom of the pot.

133
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,931
it has to be recovered in this
huge crucible with a tube.

134
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,601
the tube is dipped
into the bottom of the pot,

135
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,337
and a vacuum system
draws the molten aluminum

136
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,206
from the crucible.

137
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,346
the aluminum is recovered
in a short time.

138
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,748
air is vacuumed
from the crucible

139
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,552
by a flexible pipe
held by an operator.

140
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,221
the tube
is finally withdrawn,

141
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,225
and the overhead crane dumps
another quantity of alumina

142
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,760
into the pot.

143
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:27,064
thus, the aluminum-fabrication
process continues uninterrupted.

144
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,566
the crucibles filled
with molten aluminum

145
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,835
are transported
to the casting house.

146
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,105
their contents are poured
into holding furnaces,

147
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,574
that have a capacity
of 60 tons.

148
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,576
in these very hot furnaces,

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,114
the molten aluminum
is stored to await casting.

150
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,850
finally, casting begins.

151
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,520
the aluminum can be
semicontinuously

152
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,523
vertically cast, producing
ingots, sheets, or billets,

153
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,793
or it can be directly cast
into semifinished products.

154
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:03,266
the cooling of aluminum pieces
is accelerated by water sprays.

155
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,004
the large, rectangular ingots,
which can weigh up to 25 tons,

156
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,738
will head for hot-rolling,

157
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,608
and eventually
will be fabricated into products

158
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,411
like aluminum foil.

159
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,947
from four to five tons
of bauxite

160
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,616
have produced two tons
of alumina,

161
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,820
which in turn produces
one ton of aluminum.

162
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,758
this particular plant produces

163
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,227
200,000 tons
of aluminum annually.

164
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,363
some other facilities
can turn out as much

165
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,100
as 400,000 tons.

166
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,643
narrator: if you've ever
had to stop suddenly

167
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,779
while driving at high speed,

168
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,448
you know that
once you hit the brakes,

169
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,117
they can easily lock up,
making you skid.

170
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,187
but with the sophisticated
computer technology

171
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,456
behind today's antilock brakes,

172
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,426
skidding is becoming
a thing of the past.

173
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,732
brakes are absolutely
essential equipment

174
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,201
for every vehicle
to slow down and stop.

175
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,804
and brakes have remained
practically unchanged

176
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,672
for the past 40 years.

177
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,874
conventional disk brakes
have pads

178
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,211
that press against the brake
disk attached to the wheel.

179
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,746
these pads grip the disk

180
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,016
on only 15 to 30 degrees
of its circumference.

181
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,284
this develops high heat,
wheel skidding,

182
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,688
and results in premature wear.

183
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,423
the new floating disk brakes

184
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,492
have two pads
of friction material

185
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,095
on 360 degrees of the disk.

186
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,496
when the brake is applied,

187
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,099
hydraulic pressure
activates the diaphragm,

188
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,567
which applies pressure
on the inboard pad,

189
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,037
which is then pressed
against the disk.

190
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,507
in this animation, the diaphragm
movement is exaggerated.

191
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,110
however simple,
the design of this brake

192
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,447
calls for some
complex development steps.

193
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,515
it all starts
on the monitor screen

194
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,717
with computer-aided design.

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,121
this powerful software creates
objects in three dimensions,

196
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,356
which can be
virtually manipulated.

197
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,927
they then proceed
to digital analysis.

198
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,197
here, digital models are
submitted to repeated braking

199
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,735
to verify that the parts
conform to design objectives.

200
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,675
the software verifies changes
in heat,

201
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,545
the effects of vibration,
and resistance to breakage.

202
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,315
the right choice of materials
is critical.

203
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,091
the electrical components
also have to be created.

204
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,362
here, we see the delicate
construction of tiny sensors,

205
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,998
that measure the force exerted
by the braking system.

206
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,236
the sensor is the main component

207
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,838
of the intelligent
a.b.s. braking system,

208
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,639
which functions
more efficiently

209
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,708
than traditional
antiskid systems

210
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,844
and reduces braking distance.

211
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,251
next, it's the fabrication stage
of prototype parts,

212
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,720
which will be tested.

213
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:13,056
the machining of these parts
must take into account

214
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,492
the requirements
of mass production.

215
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,465
this high-precision,
robotized machining

216
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,402
is done by computer-controlled
digital machines.

217
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,139
a liquid sprinkled
on the machine part

218
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,074
cools it during the process.

219
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,015
the finished parts
are precisely measured,

220
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,219
then fitted and assembled to
form the total braking system,

221
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,189
which will be first tested
in the laboratory.

222
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,896
brakes in full contact
have a friction surface

223
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,033
six times superior
to traditional brakes.

224
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,171
the use of aluminum
and composite materials

225
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,508
allow for a weight savings
of 5.5 pounds per wheel.

226
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,978
this affects roadholding
and reduces fuel consumption

227
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,081
by .05 gallons
per 100 miles.

228
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,118
they proceed to power
and endurance tests

229
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,855
on this dynamometer, in which
a brake and wheel assembly

230
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,191
act against
a large rotating drum.

231
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,792
these lab tests are critical,

232
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,263
since they can detect any defect
in a braking system

233
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,932
before it's installed
on an actual vehicle.

234
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,880
in order to evaluate the power
and endurance of the brakes

235
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,615
in full application
under extreme conditions,

236
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,352
they were installed
on this porsche 911 turbo

237
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,086
entered in the motorola cup.

238
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,422
they proved
completely satisfactory,

239
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,026
and the porsche went on
to record many wins.

240
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,366
once all validation tests
are done,

241
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,434
we move on
to the next step.

242
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,303
brakes are installed on
a production-model vehicle.

243
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,106
with data systems,

244
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,974
engineers can observe
the performance of brakes

245
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,311
under all conditions
thousands of times a second.

246
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,449
finally, engineers proceed
with actual braking trials

247
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,851
with test vehicles.

248
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:24,387
all that remains is to produce
brakes on a large scale

249
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,524
to supply auto manufacturers'
production lines.

250
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,759
and that's
the story of brakes,

251
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,296
from original idea
to final product.

252
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,406
narrator:
there's nothing like the sound
of a car engine starting,

253
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,876
especially when it's 15 below
on a winter morning.

254
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,681
today's automotive batteries
are smaller, more powerful,

255
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,150
and more efficient,
even at extreme temperatures.

256
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,822
it's all thanks to the power
of lithium-ion-cell technology.

257
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,897
while dissecting a frog
in 1786,

258
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,100
the italian researcher galvani

259
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,902
noted that when his scalpel
touched a leg muscle,

260
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,639
it contracted from
an electric current produced.

261
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,508
later, volta believed
the current was produced

262
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,976
by the metal instruments,

263
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,178
the animal being
only a conductor.

264
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,381
to prove it, he stacked disks
of zinc and copper

265
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,850
connected by conductors

266
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,986
and fabric impregnated
with an acid solution.

267
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,257
and so, in 1800,
the electric battery was born.

268
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,733
batteries power all kinds
of electric motors.

269
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,070
a new lithium-metal-polymer
battery pack such as this one

270
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,672
could soon power
an electric automobile,

271
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,608
as well
as a hybrid vehicle.

272
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,811
this battery will be made up
of four components.

273
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,746
it all starts
with this lithium ingot,

274
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,949
which weighs about 11 pounds.

275
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,084
it's transformed into
a thin sheet

276
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:06,355
by this extrusion press that
applies 440 tons of pressure.

277
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,091
the press creates a sheet

278
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,160
that's only about
1/100 of an inch thick.

279
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,364
the whole extrusion sequence
is closely computer-controlled.

280
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,232
extrusion is now completed.

281
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,101
the metallic lithium sheet

282
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,771
is the required 1/100 inch
in thickness,

283
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,305
or 1/4 of a millimeter.

284
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,508
the sheet has to be
further thinned.

285
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,644
placed on a roller,
it is carried to the laminator.

286
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,414
at room temperature,
it's thinned once again.

287
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,451
in just 20 minutes,
the 11-pound ingot

288
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:38,455
will have been transformed into
a thin sheet .01 inches wide

289
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,757
and some 655 feet in length.

290
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,531
this laminator completes
the thinning of the sheet.

291
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,000
the resulting
1 1/4 mile-long sheet

292
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,570
will allow for the fabrication
of 210 battery units.

293
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,544
lithium is
a soft, sticky metal.

294
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,079
for this reason,
a polypropylene film

295
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,482
has to be fixed
onto the lithium sheet.

296
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,016
without this protection,

297
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,187
the sheet would adhere to itself
and become unusable.

298
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,957
the sheet will be used to make
individual battery cells.

299
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,626
then these cells
will be assembled,

300
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,427
in series and in parallel,

301
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,565
and inserted into modules
of different shapes.

302
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,634
to make an individual
battery cell,

303
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,503
the sheet
has to be rolled up.

304
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,171
this automated spooling machine

305
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:33,176
winds up the lithium film
in 26 revolutions.

306
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,779
the wound-up sheet
is put into a vacuum oven,

307
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,849
where the various layers
adhere firmly to one another.

308
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,117
this step lasts
for about 90 minutes

309
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,286
at 176 degrees.

310
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,593
here, a test is made.

311
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,596
using a voltmeter,
the battery is checked to see

312
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,265
that it produces
the required 3.56 volts.

313
00:18:55,268 --> 00:19:00,003
any problem can be detected here
and corrected.

314
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,605
a final quality check
is made with this caliper.

315
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,709
it precisely measures the
thickness of the battery cell.

316
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,813
the battery cells
are then stored.

317
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,483
metallic plates
are placed between them

318
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,252
for the entire storage period.

319
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,424
one more step remains,

320
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,294
and that's the metallizing
of the contacts.

321
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,631
the battery cells are sent off
to a fabrication facility

322
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,767
in this container.

323
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,236
the container
is robotically handled.

324
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,772
first, it's put into
a protective tank.

325
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,575
then the metallizing
of the contacts is done

326
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,377
by spraying on molten metal.

327
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,512
this takes
just a few seconds,

328
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,981
since the metal cools
very quickly.

329
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,455
the battery is now finished.

330
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,391
it comprises four elements --

331
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,793
lithium,
which acts as the anode,

332
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,396
a metallic oxide cathode,

333
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,931
a dry
solid polymer electrolyte,

334
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,135
and a metallic
current collector.

335
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,603
all that remains to be done

336
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,339
is the assembling of
the individual battery cells

337
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,607
into a module.

338
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,276
it begins with the placing
of individual cells

339
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,212
onto one another
and isolating them with foam

340
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,615
so that they do not touch
each other.

341
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,218
these red sheets
are actually heating elements,

342
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,687
since the lithium-metal-polymer
cells function

343
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,525
at temperatures of between
104 and 176 degrees.

344
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,442
here, we see these modules
of a battery pack

345
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,776
for a hybrid vehicle,

346
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,179
an automobile that works
with a gasoline-powered motor

347
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,048
and an electric motor.

348
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,718
this prototype battery

349
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,053
was created for
a totally electric vehicle.

350
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,589
it surpasses heavy
traditional lead-acid batteries

351
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:04,060
that can't develop the same
amount of electrical energy

352
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,663
and have much shorter
life-spans.
