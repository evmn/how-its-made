00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,188
narrator: tiny motion sensors known as accelerometers    

4
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,991
are at the heart of much of today's technology. 

5
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,259
built into a smartphone,    

6
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,795
for example, the sensor detects both movement     

7
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:05,264
and the angle at which the phone
is being held         

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,532
to trigger the rotation of the screen.         

9
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,601
this little chip is      

10
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,003
why a smartphone knows when it has moved.    

11
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,476
these motion sensors are tiny, 

12
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,246
but smart, because they can detect every move.     

13
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:26,618
they start with silicon disks called wafers.         

14
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,956
each wafer will be used to make
thousands of motion sensors.  

15
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,362
a technician aligns the disks in a cassette,         

16
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,198
using the flat part of each one
as a reference point.     

17
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,036
once properly aligned,     

18
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,772
a mechanism lowers the silicon wafers onto a carrier     

19
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:50,009
made of quartz, which can withstand intense heat.    

20
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:55,281
the technician loads the wafers
into the furnace.       

21
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:02,387
inside, the 2,000-degree heat and steam cause an oxide    

22
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,725
to form on the surface of each wafer.         

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,960
it'll act as an electrical insulator.  

24
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:16,401
then it goes into what's known as a sputter system.      

25
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,472
here, inert gas ions bombard aluminum,       

26
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,540
causing it to sputter onto the wafer         

27
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,810
until an even layer accumulates.

28
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:29,415
this aluminum layer will serve as a conductor of electricity. 

29
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:32,084
the next machine deposits a light-sensitive chemical   

30
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,819
onto the wafer.        

31
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,287
the wafer spins,        

32
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,224
allowing the chemical to flow evenly across the surface.   

33
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,829
this all happens under the glow
of yellow light        

34
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,599
to prevent the untimely activation of the chemical,  

35
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,234
which reacts to bright light  

36
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,803
just like an unexposed photographic negative would.  

37
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,112
they're now ready for that bright light.     

38
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,648
u.v. light beams through tiny patterns on a glass plate   

39
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,452
to activate the light-sensitive chemical. 

40
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,255
the patterns transfer to the wafer's surface,    

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,224
forming an outline       
for thousands of motion sensors.

42
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,529
another chemical then flows onto the silicon wafer  

43
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,999
to further develop these miniscule images.    

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,275
next, lasers locate the wafer's flat edge, 

45
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,010
signaling a chuck       

46
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,214
to spin into its proper position
for plasma etching.      

47
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:39,084
the etching creates thousands of free-moving 3-d structures. 

48
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:40,953
each one is a motion sensor.  

49
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,957
after etching,         

50
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,227
a sprayer blasts the surface with carbon dioxide.      

51
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,696
it's the only way to clean it without damaging  

52
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,298
the now-movable sensors.    

53
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,700
at the next station,      

54
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:59,505
a robotic arm flips the wafer into position. 

55
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,842
a tray moves under the robot and places the wafer on it.  

56
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,647
the tray retracts and loads the wafer      

57
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:09,915
into a clamping system.    

58
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,990
it then collects a second silicon wafer     

59
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,527
and places it on the first one in the clamp. 

60
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,196
the second wafer acts as a lid            

61
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,065
to protect the individual sensors.    

62
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,536
held in the clamp, a machine heat-seals the two wafers,   

63
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,004
and the bond is complete.   

64
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,213
next, a computerized saw cuts 
grooves into the top wafer only,

65
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,417
while a steady stream of water keeps the dust down.      

66
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,754
the saw exposes the aluminum layer on the bottom wafer,   

67
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,822
something that will allow each sensor          

68
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,758
to make an electrical connection.          

69
00:04:56,597 --> 00:05:00,065
a platform now moves the wafer a millimeter at a time     

70
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,367
so that a probe can test each sensor      

71
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,304
and confirm it performs correctly.     

72
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,840
this continues until every sensor on the wafer

73
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,141
has been tested.        

74
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:13,178
from a plain silicon wafer   

75
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,582
to a unit that contains thousands of motion sensors -- 

76
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,651
this process takes three weeks.

77
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,255
after the individual sensors  

78
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,657
have been cut and encased in plastic,    

79
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,126
they're ready for a final test.

80
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:32,397
a robot loads each sensor into a test socket.      

81
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,267
the socket both tests the sensor's performance    

82
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:39,471
and programs it to customer specifications.  

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,609
a robot packages the sensors for shipping.         

84
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,744
and once installed in phones, tablets,      

85
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,012
and computers,         

86
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,782
these motion sensors will be ready for action.   

87
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,099
narrator: if you've been to an airport, 

88
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,501
you've seen mobile belt loaders
on the tarmac.         

89
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,103
they drive from the terminal to the aircraft,        

90
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,705
align their built-in conveyor belt  

91
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,507
with the entrance to the cargo hold,       

92
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,177
then load baggage or cargo on board.           

93
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,778
when an aircraft arrives,   

94
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,315
they do all that in reverse to unload baggage or cargo.  

95
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,519
a turn of the control handle  

96
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,456
adjusts the height       
of the front of the belt loader,

97
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,725
enabling it to reach the cargo hold         

98
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,060
of even the tallest aircraft.     

99
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,495
the rear height is also adjustable       

100
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,331
so the airport baggage handlers

101
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,267
can set it at a level comfortable for loading.    

102
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:45,671
the vehicle and the conveyor belt are separate units.    

103
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,272
in this part of the factory,  

104
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,343
workers construct the conveyor's steel frame.  

105
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,813
they weld together all the steel parts      

106
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,215
then grind all the weld seams flat    

107
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,618
so that the belt will move over the frame smoothly.    

108
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,956
workers install a crossmember 

109
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,358
just past the midpoint of the frame.         

110
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,493
it will connect with two sets of lift arms          

111
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,428
installed in the vehicle --  

112
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,465
one which raises and lowers the front of the conveyor,   

113
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,167
the other which raises and lowers the rear.      

114
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,902
workers insert alignment pins 

115
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,440
to position the crossmember on the frame correctly,    

116
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,575
then weld it into place.    

117
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,979
the vehicle's chassis is also made of welded steel. 

118
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,513
workers blast the chassis   

119
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,583
and conveyor frame with a metal abrasive.     

120
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,185
this removes rust and other debris,       

121
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,056
prepping the surface for paint to adhere properly.      

122
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,261
the caulk all the unwelded seams
to prevent corrosion,     

123
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,129
then spray a coat of primer  

124
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,464
followed by a coat of industrial-grade paint   

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,002
in the color the customer requested.           

126
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:53,405
once the paint dries, assembly can resume.      

127
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,673
on the conveyor frame,     

128
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:57,675
they install the motor, which drives the belt.     

129
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,678
there are two options available --          

130
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,815
this hydraulic motor powered by the vehicle's engine

131
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,016
or an electric motor      

132
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,184
powered by battery.      

133
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,622
the motor rotates two large metal rollers --     

134
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,090
one at the front of the frame, 

135
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:14,493
the other at the rear.     

136
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,628
the belt wraps around these rollers so that, 

137
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,630
when they turn, the belt moves.

138
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,569
between the end rollers,    

139
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,171
running the entire length of the conveyor,        

140
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,908
workers install 58 smaller metal
rollers.            

141
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,910
these form the floor of the conveyor        

142
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,247
and can support up to a ton of cargo.     

143
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:38,583
the motor runs these rollers forward or in reverse,     

144
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,518
depending on whether the belt is loading           

145
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,054
or unloading the aircraft.   

146
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,860
the belt itself is made of high-strength tire-grade rubber

147
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,463
with an antiskid texture on the surface.        

148
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:54,933
to be long enough to loop   
around the 25-foot-long conveyor

149
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,702
plus the end rollers,     

150
00:08:56,804 --> 00:09:00,205
the belt is 50 feet in length. 

151
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,675
the ends have teeth which fit into each other like a zipper 

152
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,144
and fasten with a metal pin.  

153
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,418
elsewhere in the factory,   

154
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,521
technicians install components on the vehicle chassis.    

155
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,361
first, the front and rear axles...       

156
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:32,838
...then on each axle, two wheels
with tires specifically designed

157
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,007
for long life on the airport tarmac.     

158
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,779
at the rear of the chassis, they
install the hydraulic cylinder,

159
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:45,050
which raises and lowers the rear
lift arms,           

160
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,119
then the vehicle's engine,   

161
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,855
which can be either gas, diesel, propane,        

162
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,723
or electric powered.      

163
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,859
the vehicle drives at a maximum speed       

164
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,394
of just 25 miles per hour,   

165
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,464
but that's more than sufficient

166
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:02,000
for traveling between the terminal and the aircraft. 

167
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,603
after installing the power-steering system,   

168
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,937
technicians run wiring     

169
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,606
for the lights         
and other electrical components,

170
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,877
run hydraulic hoses for the brakes and lift cylinders, 

171
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,280
and install the controls for the conveyor.       

172
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,015
they install the hydraulic cylinder,    

173
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,818
which raises the front lift arms,      

174
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:24,489
then connect the fluid hoses to the hydraulic pump.     

175
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,225
next, they install the front and rear lift arms  

176
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,428
along with a safety brace underneath           

177
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:33,298
to use when mechanics are working beneath the conveyor. 

178
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,635
they attach the lift arms   
to the front and rear cylinders,

179
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,240
which expand to raise the arms and retract to lower them.   

180
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,443
now workers hoist the conveyor over the vehicle        

181
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,312
and bolt the front and rear lift
arms to the crossmember    

182
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,847
on the conveyor's underside.           

183
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:55,520
the two units are now one mobile belt loader,

184
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,490
ready to roll off the line and hit the tarmac.      

185
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,612
narrator: the pheasant is one of
the most sought-after game birds

186
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,080
in north america,       

187
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,017
but populations in the wild have dwindled.   

188
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,150
to replenish them       

189
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,554
and also supply a market for pheasant meat,       

190
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,690
farmers raise breeding stock and incubate their eggs    

191
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,226
to make it more likely they'll yield chicks.     

192
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,368
with stunning plumage and an ability to both run and fly,

193
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,437
no wonder the pheasant struts around.  

194
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,576
each pheasant lays approximately four eggs weekly,

195
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,646
april through to july.     

196
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,048
farm workers collect the eggs daily     

197
00:11:56,183 --> 00:12:00,252
before the pheasants have an opportunity to nest.  

198
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,520
with their intervention,    

199
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,056
the hatch rate will get a big boost.     

200
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,793
it will go from 40% to at least 75%.        

201
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,999
the farmer washes the eggs in water and special soap   

202
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,667
to remove dirt and bacteria  

203
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,335
that could infiltrate the shells

204
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,137
and harm the growing chicks.      

205
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,809
she inspects the eggs     

206
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,879
and rejects any cracked or very large ones       

207
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,548
that would contain a double yolk.         

208
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,051
eggs with cracks or double yolks won't hatch.  

209
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,957
one last dip,         

210
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,326
and she sets the eggs aside to drip dry.       

211
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:48,700
once dry, she taps eggs together
systematically and listens.  

212
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,703
if the tap sounds like fine china clinking together, 

213
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,871
they're suitable for hatching. 

214
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,776
but if the tap sounds dull, there's likely a crack.    

215
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,511
by listening, she finds one or two cracked eggs 

216
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,716
she missed with the visual inspection.  

217
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,319
she places the eggs in an incubator rack      

218
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,855
and transfers it to a cooling room.       

219
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,458
the pheasant eggs chill here for a few days.      

220
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,794
the cooling slows down cell division    

221
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,865
until the farmer is ready to put
the eggs in the incubator.   

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,634
chick production is timed for two hatches weekly.    

223
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,739
when the time is right,    

224
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:30,042
she transfers the eggs to the incubator.       

225
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,747
the incubator is a toasty 100 degrees fahrenheit

226
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,883
to mimic the warmth of a hen's body.        

227
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,758
she latches the racks onto an automated system    

228
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,494
that gently rocks the long cradles back and forth

229
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,096
to turn the pheasant eggs.   

230
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,267
turning the eggs routinely is something     

231
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,569
that nesting hens do naturally,

232
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,304
and it's important.      

233
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,574
without it, the developing   
embryo could stick to the shell,

234
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,510
causing abnormal growth.    

235
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,113
the farmer monitors the incubator temperature   

236
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,649
and humidity several times daily.      

237
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:12,650
three weeks later,       

238
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,051
she removes the rack      

239
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:18,123
and places it on a tray lined with cheesecloth.    

240
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,858
she opens each cradle,     

241
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,094
and the eggs spill softly onto the tray.  

242
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:25,664
at this point,         

243
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,999
there are tiny pits on the shells         

244
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:32,604
caused by the chicks' beaks as they attempt to break through. 

245
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,072
once on the tray,       

246
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,076
she arranges them close together
in a figure-eight configuration.

247
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,878
this way, the chicks can feel each other moving,  

248
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,014
cuing them to break out of their shells.      

249
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,888
she pumps water onto the tiers of the hatcher now.      

250
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,457
the hatcher is warmer than the incubator.      

251
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,302
she covers the trays with screens to keep the chicks

252
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,038
from jumping onto other trays. 

253
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,142
as the water heats up, the humidity increases.    

254
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,846
this causes the shells to weaken,           

255
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,648
making it easier for the pheasant chicks    

256
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,316
to break out of their shells. 

257
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,320
after a couple of days,    

258
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,523
the eggs have hatched.     

259
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:27,959
after drying off, the chicks are fluffy and lively.     

260
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,333
the farmer packs them in ventilated cardboard boxes. 

261
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,668
freshly hatched,        

262
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,071
they'll survive 60 hours    
without food, giving the breeder

263
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,609
enough time to ship them anywhere in the world.     

264
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,745
that's why pheasants are easier to ship       

265
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,547
when they're chicks.      

266
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,484
some customers prefer more mature birds,   

267
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,954
so the farmer raises some chicks
in wire frames for a week,   

268
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,023
until their legs become stronger.     

269
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,826
then they move those chicks to other heated buildings   

270
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,096
until they're ready to thrive outdoors.           

271
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,499
some will be kept as breeding stock.       

272
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,035
others will be sold as food.  

273
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,705
the rest will be introduced  
into the wild and just fly away.

274
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,718
today's diving helmets     

275
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,787
are produced primarily for history buffs       

276
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,255
and divers performing underwater work,        

277
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,259
such as welding the submerged parts of bridges.

278
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,593
unlike a scuba tank,      

279
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,996
which carries a limited amount of oxygen,           

280
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,731
a helmet connects to an air pump
at the surface,        

281
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,701
providing an unlimited air supply.          

282
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:48,006
a diving helmet is completely watertight    

283
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,942
so the diver doesn't need a mouthpiece to breathe  

284
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,745
and can speak to people at the surface         

285
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,747
via a built-in transceiver.  

286
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,283
this helmet is the design the u.s. navy used       

287
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,953
from 1916 until 1984.     

288
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,756
at the factory, they make the helmet's head portion,

289
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,091
called the bonnet, from a copper sheet      

290
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,027
about a millimeter and a half thick             

291
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,630
that's been spun on a lathe into a dome.  

292
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,700
they buff it smooth, then, using a template,    

293
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,570
mark where to cut openings for the various components.  

294
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,042
it takes a good month and a half

295
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,112
for the factory to machine all those components

296
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,849
and assemble the helmet.    

297
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,385
with a hammer and punch,    

298
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,853
they dimple the copper at the marked spots.      

299
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,055
this will give the saw     

300
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,724
a foothold on the otherwise slippery surface.       

301
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,730
then they apply cutting oil to prevent the saw       

302
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,433
from overheating as it bores through the metal. 

303
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,072
the first cut is a 6-inch-wide hole at the front       

304
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,942
for the bonnet's hinged faceplate.       

305
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,879
they saw eight openings for the bonnet's other components, 

306
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:04,149
including three windows.    

307
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,417
next, with tin-and-lead solder,

308
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,754
they fuse a threaded neck ring to the bottom edge.      

309
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,424
this ring attaches the bonnet to the helmet's breastplate,  

310
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:17,228
which bolts to the collar of the diver's dry suit.    

311
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,498
then they solder a base to the faceplate opening.   

312
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,367
like all the helmet's components,          

313
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,369
it's made of red brass,    

314
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,770
which is more durable     

315
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,507
than standard brass due to its higher copper content.     

316
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,510
next, through a template, they drill holes        

317
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,447
into a banana-shaped brass exhaust tube.      

318
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:39,718
it enables the diver's exhaled air to exit the helmet.

319
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,986
they solder the exhaust to the bonnet,         

320
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,855
positioning the non-perforated end     

321
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,191
over a hole near the diver's mouth     

322
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,593
and the perforated end at the rear.          

323
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,596
this directs air bubbles behind the diver        

324
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,065
so as not to obstruct the view.

325
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,534
then they solder on the remaining components,  

326
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,138
including three window bases. 

327
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,541
just as one does when installing
a window in a building,    

328
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,811
they apply glazing to the faceplate and window bases 

329
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,216
to seal the three-inch thick acrylic pane against leaks.  

330
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,685
for underwater safety,     

331
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,621
they screw a brass guard to the base.          

332
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,690
this prevents the pane from popping out        

333
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,526
should too much air pressure build up inside the helmet.  

334
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,164
now they install the transceiver

335
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,632
and feed its wires through a brass elbow,     

336
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,436
which will ultimately     
attach to a communications cable

337
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,737
running to the surface.    

338
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,709
with the bonnet complete,   

339
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,378
it's time to shape the helmet's breastplate.   

340
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,646
they lay a copper sheet    

341
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,781
onto a breastplate-shaped mandrel,            

342
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,650
clamp on a breastplate-shaped form,   

343
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,054
heat the copper with a torch to make it malleable, 

344
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,390
then, with a wooden mallet soaked in brine        

345
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,925
to keep it from splitting,   

346
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,795
pound the copper for about 45 minutes,       

347
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,131
until it assumes the shape.  

348
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,000
then they chisel out the neck opening.       

349
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,143
once the copper has cooled,  

350
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,746
they transfer the breastplate to a form           

351
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,549
and begin reinforcing the bottom
with a brass strap.      

352
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,019
after clamping the strap in position,          

353
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,090
they hammer the copper around and over its outer edge.

354
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,562
then they remove the clamps  

355
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,098
and solder the copper to the strap.         

356
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,835
once the soldering's done, they grind the surface smooth 

357
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,305
and drill 12 holes into the strap         

358
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,040
for the custom-made bolts   

359
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:46,177
that connect the helmet to the collar of the diver's dry suit.

360
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,447
then, after flipping the breastplate upside down,  

361
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,249
they wrap solder around the bolts,       

362
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:55,587
drop them in the holes, and melt
the solder to lock them in.  

363
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,728
they polish the metal     

364
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,531
and solder on the last breastplate components --   

365
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,134
a threaded neck ring for connecting the bonnet   

366
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,336
and, at the front, a pair of brass eyes      

367
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,539
for lashing the air- and communication hoses    

368
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,874
off to the side        

369
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,676
so they won't get in the diver's way underwater.
