00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,940
the whistle's body is made of   
high-grade brass tubing, in     
which two slots are punched.    

145
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,708
high-grade brass tubing, in     
which two slots are punched.    
these are sound holes that

that's a bit like an hourglass. 

152
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:23,774
with the mouthpiece complete, a 
hydraulic punch is used to bend 
a piece of brass into a part    

153
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,009
hydraulic punch is used to bend 
a piece of brass into a part    
called the slab.                

154
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,111
a piece of brass into a part    
called the slab.                
the slab will be used to create

157
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,989
two sound chambers inside the   
whistle.                        
a loop is fitted on to an endcap

160
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,796
to make the whistle easier to   
hang on to.                     
a rotating press bends the

permanently.                    

164
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,951
next, an endcap is attached to  
the slab, and then the slab is  
forced into the cavity of the   

165
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,820
the slab, and then the slab is  
forced into the cavity of the   
whistle, splitting it into two

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,493
whistle, splitting it into two  
chambers.                       
a police whistle actually

chambers.                       
a police whistle actually       
produces two notes at once,     

169
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,862
a police whistle actually       
produces two notes at once,     
giving it that distinctive

giving it that distinctive      
tambour.                        

171
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,964
giving it that distinctive      
tambour.                        
these two separate sound        

172
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,566
tambour.                        
these two separate sound        
chambers will produce two       

173
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:26,237
these two separate sound        
chambers will produce two       
different pitches.              

174
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,972
chambers will produce two       
different pitches.              
now the ends of the whistle are 

175
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,708
different pitches.              
now the ends of the whistle are 
dipped in solder paste and then 

176
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,376
now the ends of the whistle are 
dipped in solder paste and then 
the looped cap and mouthpiece   

177
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,911
dipped in solder paste and then 
the looped cap and mouthpiece   
are hammered onto the pasted    

178
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,246
the looped cap and mouthpiece   
are hammered onto the pasted    
ends.                           

179
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,047
are hammered onto the pasted    
ends.                           
the solder paste is a special   

180
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,748
ends.                           
the solder paste is a special   
lead-free compound so the       

181
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,651
the solder paste is a special   
lead-free compound so the       
whistle-blower won't be exposed 

182
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,253
lead-free compound so the       
whistle-blower won't be exposed 
to toxins.                      

183
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:58,136
solder wires are also inserted  
in the whistle chambers before  
capping the ends.               

184
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,804
in the whistle chambers before  
capping the ends.               
these solder wires will act in  

185
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,339
capping the ends.               
these solder wires will act in  
conjunction with the solder     

186
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,974
these solder wires will act in  
conjunction with the solder     
paste to seal the whistle in a  

187
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,810
conjunction with the solder     
paste to seal the whistle in a  
process that happens next.      

188
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,378
paste to seal the whistle in a  
process that happens next.      
the whistles move through an    

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,013
process that happens next.      
the whistles move through an    
electromagnetic conduction coil,

190
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,615
the whistles move through an    
electromagnetic conduction coil,
which heats them to a smoking   

191
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:15,086
electromagnetic conduction coil,
which heats them to a smoking   
425 degrees.                    

192
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,254
which heats them to a smoking   
425 degrees.                    
this causes the solder paste and

193
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,256
425 degrees.                    
this causes the solder paste and
wires inside to melt and flow   

194
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,426
this causes the solder paste and
wires inside to melt and flow   
into the whistle's seams.       

195
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,438
each whistle is then dipped in  
an acid bath, which hardens the 
solder, sealing the whistle's   

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,308
an acid bath, which hardens the 
solder, sealing the whistle's   
seams.                          

197
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,177
solder, sealing the whistle's   
seams.                          
next, the whistles are lowered  

198
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,845
seams.                          
next, the whistles are lowered  
into a nickel bath, where       

199
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,713
next, the whistles are lowered  
into a nickel bath, where       
positively charged nickel ions

202
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,464
now it's time to make some      
noise.                          
each whistle is tested with     

203
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,434
noise.                          
each whistle is tested with     
compressed air.                 

204
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,470
each whistle is tested with     
compressed air.                 
the tiniest pinhole will cause a

00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,138
compressed air.                 
the tiniest pinhole will cause a
whistle to fail, and that       

206
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,742
the tiniest pinhole will cause a
whistle to fail, and that       
happens in 3% of them.

experience.                     

209
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,946
failure is a crushing           
experience.                     
the rejects get flattened and

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,527
and with that, production at    
this whistle factory comes to a 
screeching halt.

every feature is scaled-down to 
a fraction of the real thing,   

229
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,116
every feature is scaled-down to 
a fraction of the real thing,   
and nothing is too small to

258
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,683
to shape melted plastic into a  
boxcar.                         
they even create holes in the

00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,981
off the framework and files     
down the rough sections.        
that is the brake wheel she's   

268

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,160
excess plastic from the train   
car's step.                     
she then glues a steel weight to

make it 1/48th the weight of the
real thing.                     
making something to scale is a  

278
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,502
real thing.                     
making something to scale is a  
bit of a balancing act.         

279
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,338
making something to scale is a  
bit of a balancing act.         
finally, she attaches air-brake 

280
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,207
bit of a balancing act.         
finally, she attaches air-brake 
tanks to the underframe of the  

281
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,841
finally, she attaches air-brake 
tanks to the underframe of the  
car, and it's time to           

282
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,944
tanks to the underframe of the  
car, and it's time to           
spray-paint the model train car 

283
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,012
car, and it's time to           
spray-paint the model train car 
vivid orange.                   

284
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,613
spray-paint the model train car 
vivid orange.                   
it's a color that would have    

285
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,381
vivid orange.                   
it's a color that would have    
been used on an actual boxcar,  

286
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:42,620
it's a color that would have    
been used on an actual boxcar,  
combined with white.            

287
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,155
been used on an actual boxcar,  
combined with white.            
for that two-toned look, the

model is held in a paint shield,
which protects the orange       
sections as they spray on the   

291
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,062
which protects the orange       
sections as they spray on the

292
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,797
sections as they spray on the   
white.                          
this technique ensures the

this technique ensures the      
paint job has clean lines.      

294
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:10,714
the car is left to dry          
overnight.                      
not all paint jobs are so

the machine then slowly reheats 
the half blocks until their     
edges start melting.            

398
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,328
next, they enter the part of the
machine called the squeeze      
station.                        

399
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,397
machine called the squeeze      
station.                        
here, an automated press forces

here, an automated press forces 
a top half and bottom half      

401
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,066
here, an automated press forces 
a top half and bottom half      
together.                       

402
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,235
a top half and bottom half      
together.                       
their melted edges fuse, forming

403
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,737
together.                       
their melted edges fuse, forming
a single block.                 

404
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,014
the blocks now travel into a    
leer, an oven that cools the    
glass at regulated temperatures 

405
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,416
leer, an oven that cools the    
glass at regulated temperatures 
over several hours.             

406

this annealing process prevents 
cracking and allows the glass   

408
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,888
this annealing process prevents 
cracking and allows the glass

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,723
cracking and allows the glass   
time to set properly.           
the glass goes in at about      

410
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,492
time to set properly.           
the glass goes in at about      
1,800 degrees.                  

411
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,630
the glass goes in at about      
1,800 degrees.                  
coming out, it's down to 175.   

412
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:38,108
the blocks are now ready for    
inspection.                     
workers use digital-alignment   

413
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,044
inspection.                     
workers use digital-alignment   
gauges to make sure both halves 

414
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,878
workers use digital-alignment   
gauges to make sure both halves 
are flush.                      

415
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,380
gauges to make sure both halves 
are flush.                      
then they run a straight piece

00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,121
distortion.                     
every block must meet precise   
standards for both size and     

421
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:54,157
every block must meet precise   
standards for both size and     
shape -- a 7½-inch square that's

422
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,896
standards for both size and

4 inches thick.                 
building with glass blocks is   

424
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,532
4 inches thick.                 
building with glass blocks is   
similar to building with        

425
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,268
building with glass blocks is   
similar to building with        
bricks -- you use mortar to

to prep the blocks for          
mortaring, workers now place    

429
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,341
to prep the blocks for          
mortaring, workers now place    
each one onto a separate

this coating will help the      
mortar stick to the glass       

435
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,920
this coating will help the      
mortar stick to the glass

436
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,998
just one last step.             
an ink-jet printer applies the  
product code along with the     

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,936
an ink-jet printer applies the  
product code along with the     
manufacturing date and time.    

438
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,505
product code along with the     
manufacturing date and time.    
the quality-control department  

439
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,107
manufacturing date and time.    
the quality-control department  
runs samples through an impact  

440
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:43,674
the quality-control department  
runs samples through an impact  
test.                           

441
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,542
runs samples through an impact  
test.                           
a worker drops a weight through

block.                          

444
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,580
a tube onto the side of the     
block.                          
this verifies the strength of   

445
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,281
block.                          
this verifies the strength of   
the sidewall and the seal       

446
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,017
this verifies the strength of   
the sidewall and the seal       
between the two halves.         

447
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:56,387
finally, the glass blocks are   

448
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,588
ready for shipping.             

449
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,324
workers pack them into cardboard

450
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,926
boxes that have block-sized     

451
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,527
sections to keep them safe      

452
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,597
during transport.               

453
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,799
glass blocks come in so many    

454
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,269
shapes, sizes, and patterns that

455
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,036
the design possibilities are    

456
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:13,704
endless.                        

457
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,439
both practical and beautiful,   

458
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,940
it's no wonder they're so       

459
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,508
popular with builders and       

460
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,480
decorators alike.
