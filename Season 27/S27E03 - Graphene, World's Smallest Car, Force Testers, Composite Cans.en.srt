narrator: today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,188
in 2004, british scientists   

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,659
extracted a substance      
called graphene from graphite,  

6
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,394
which is the material used to make pencils.         

7
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,064
they won the nobel prize for this discovery        

8
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,933
and left their mark on physics history.       

9
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,602
scientists continue to explore  

10
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:12,238
graphene's extraordinary potential.            

11
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,009
these silicon chips are dyed with thin flecks    

12
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,612
of carbon, known as graphene.  

13
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,948
just one atom thick and transparent,         

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,351
graphene can sniff out chemicals in the air            

15
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,821
and disease enzymes in blood.  

16
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,293
this lab manufactures graphene using a process known      

17
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,031
as chemical vapor deposition.  

18
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,702
a technician loads a capsule  
containing a copper foil sheet  

19
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:44,036
into a furnace.         

20
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,439
he screws a cap on the end of the capsule    

21
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,307
and shuts the furnace.      

22
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,642
he activates a system      

23
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:54,112
that uses argon gas to drive out oxygen.       

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,182
when the furnace reaches about 1,800 degrees fahrenheit,           

25
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,385
methane gas and hydrogen are added.            

26
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,523
a reaction occurs that deposits graphene onto the foil.     

27
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:09,327
graphene can't be seen with the naked eye.       

28
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,064
a technician applies tiny gold contacts        

29
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,666
to a silicon wafer        

30
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,136
and then submerges it in solvent to rinse off the excess gold.  

31
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:21,273
the remaining gold bits serve as electrical contacts.  

32
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:27,413
a dip in acetone cleans off more of the loose flakes,    

33
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:30,483
and a final rinse in alcohol removes the rest.   

34
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,559
using a diamond-tip scribe, he scores the silicon wafer   

35
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,428
and breaks it along the score lines,      

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,964
creating rectangular chips.   

37
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,771
another technician deposits liquid plastic     

38
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:57,242
onto the transparent graphene on the copper foil.       

39
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,846
he locks the foil in a machine called a spin coater.      

40
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,382
it spins at 3,000 r.p.m.     

41
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,850
this spreads the plastic     

42
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,787
evenly across the graphene film on the foil.           

43
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:12,057
it also accelerates the plastic's curing process.  

44
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,060
he then separates the plastic-coated graphene   

45
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,662
from the copper foil.      

46
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,664
to do this,           

47
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,334
he clips a wire to set of tweezers.       

48
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,137
using the tweezers, he picks up a small piece    

49
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,007
of the plastic, graphene, and copper sandwich       

50
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,475
and plunges it in the water.   

51
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,746
the tweezers apply an electrical charge through the copper,    

52
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:36,282
causing bubbles to form in the water.      

53
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,216
these bubbles lift the graphene            

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,953
and plastic film away from the copper.      

55
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:45,691
the graphene now clings only to the plastic backing.   

56
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,360
he scoops the plastic-backed graphene square         

57
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,897
out of the water using a large piece of plastic.    

58
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,232
to remove contaminants,     

59
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,969
he immerses the square in a series of solutions.    

60
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,304
in the last solution,      

61
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,839
he slides the square off the carrier.         

62
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,509
and the square floats freely.  

63
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,245
he picks up the silicon chip with tweezers          

64
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,181
and uses it to retrieve the floating graphene      

65
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,584
and plastic square.       

66
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,154
it now sits on the silicon chip.              

67
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,792
after taping metal stencils   

68
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,395
over three of the graphene-covered chips,   

69
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,931
he suspends them above gold pellets        

70
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,801
in a machine known as the evaporator.         

71
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:36,776
he closes the evaporator, then turns up the heat.     

72
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,882
a vacuum pulls the gold toward the stencils       

73
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,051
as it evaporates.        

74
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,689
the gold and exposed graphene  

75
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,692
adhere to one another as they cool and solidify.    

76
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,361
the technician removes the stencils from the chips,   

77
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,430
revealing gold horizontal runners        

78
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,233
between the gold contacts.    

79
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,436
he transfers the chip to a plasma etcher.       

80
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,771
he activates the chip,      

81
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,307
and plasma gas floods the chamber.       

82
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:12,845
the gas strips off any graphene that's not protected by gold.  

83
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,446
only the gold contacts      

84
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:18,116
and gold-covered graphene runners remain on the chip.   

85
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,519
solvent dissolves the plastic backing       

86
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,321
on the graphene runners,     

87
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:26,658
taking the protective gold with it, leaving only graphene.            

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,529
the technician now has a graphene sensor chip.   

89
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,866
it's time to test its sensory powers    

90
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,069
using antibodies        
for a certain disease protein.  

91
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:41,473
the antibodies attach to the surface of the graphene.            

92
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,475
she tests the signal from the chip          

93
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,746
to confirm that it reads the protein correctly.           

94
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,482
this graphene chip is ready to act         

95
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,852
as a high-tech sixth sense.   

96
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,199
98                

97
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,503
narrator: the world's smallest car     

98
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,639
has held the guinness book of world records title      

99
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,242
for more than 50 years.     

100
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,912
designed and manufactured in the u.k.,           

101
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,848
it's about 6 feet long and 3 feet wide.         

102
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,684
it fits one driver but no passengers.        

103
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,989
intended as a commuter vehicle,            

104
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,060
the world's smallest car travels up to 40 miles per hour.              

105
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,801
technicians craft the body in molds section by section.   

106
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,070
first, they spread an epoxy resin          

107
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,172
in the customer's color choice.             

108
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,010
once the resin cures,      

109
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,011
they lay a sheet of fiberglass matting      

110
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,847
and impregnate it with resin.  

111
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,621
this bonds the matting to the gelcoat layer.      

112
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,023
narrower strips of matting    

113
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,091
are applied around the perimeter.      

114
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,764
certain areas are reinforced   

115
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,436
with a more porous fiberglass matting to absorb more resin.  

116
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,773
finally, a second layer of fiberglass matting and resin              

117
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,908
is set over the entire mold.   

118
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:30,382
the molds cure for a day.    

119
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,717
when they're ready,       

120
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,988
the body sections are extracted from their molds.             

121
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,057
this is the main section.    

122
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,996
the gelcoat forms a smooth and shiny finish         

123
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,666
on the sturdy fiberglass underneath.           

124
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,273
using a saw equipped with a small blade,       

125
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,776
technicians smooth the edges of the fiberglass.        

126
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,217
elsewhere in the factory, technicians weld together    

127
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,221
the car's lightweight aluminum gas tank.        

128
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,724
it holds 1 gallon of gas.    

129
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,530
they drill a hole through it...              

130
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:25,037
then weld on the filler tube and screw on the cap.      

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,241
the car runs on three wheels --               

132
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:34,380
two at the front and one driven by the engine at the back.    

133
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,982
technicians assemble the wheel hubs,         

134
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,451
then mount them         
onto the triangular suspension  

135
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,153
of the axle.           

136
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,657
they flip over the steel chassis             

137
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,594
and install the disc brakes on each wheel.          

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,067
on the rear wheel, they mount a sprocket,      

139
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:59,070
which allows the engine to drive a chain that rotates the wheel.             

140
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,873
they connect the shock absorber on the rear wheel        

141
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,409
to a mount underneath the body  

142
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,278
and install hydraulic brake lines      

143
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,615
and brake calipers on all three wheels.       

144
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,751
they bolt the wheels      
and tires onto the wheel hubs.  

145
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,821
each tire is about 6 inches in diameter.           

146
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,957
after installing the one-cylinder engine     

147
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,161
in the middle of the body, technicians bolt on the chassis.            

148
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,630
they connect the shock absorber on the rear wheel        

149
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,833
to a mount underneath the body.              

150
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,769
they install all the electrical components,           

151
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,904
such as the headlight, the brake lights,        

152
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,441
the turn signals and the wiper.             

153
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,576
the car can be ordered with an electric engine,     

154
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,045
in which case they install    

155
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,614
four 12-volt rechargeable batteries.     

156
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,054
the car has a rack-and-pinion steering system.         

157
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,723
the steering column is attached to a circular gear,       

158
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,125
called a pinion.         

159
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,926
when the driver turns the steering wheel     

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,461
in one direction,        

161
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,464
the pinion moves in that direction along the rack.    

162
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,266
the rack is a track with teeth,             

163
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,069
connected by rods to the front wheels.       

164
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:09,140
it moves and turns the wheels, steering the car.        

165
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,144
the vehicle is mechanically complete.    

166
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:16,614
now, they install the windshield and windows,           

167
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,351
sealing the aluminum frames with silicone.          

168
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,295
inside, they mount the steering wheel and the dashboard,     

169
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,697
which houses the speedometer, turn signal light,        

170
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,634
and high beams.         

171
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,168
they hang the door,       

172
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,405
which has been fitted with chromed hinges and a handle.   

173
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,243
the style is consistent with the 1960s design      

174
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,780
of the car.           

175
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:49,982
they finish the job       

176
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,252
with the installation of a vinyl driver seat,     

177
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:56,655
gas tank, and windshield washer fluid reservoir.     

178
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,263
the world's smallest car is ready to hit the road     

179
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,465
and make a big impression.    

180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,813
force testers pull and compress products      

181
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,515
to their breaking point.     

182
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,552
they're used in labs and factories          

183
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,690
to evaluate a product's quality.            

184
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,892
a force tester verifies that an object     

185
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,296
meets the manufacturer's required specifications.     

186
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,844
force testers are built to pull and compress.      

187
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:57,049
here, a tester arm bears down on a pencil.     

188
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,184
it determines how much force can be applied       

189
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,654
before the pencil bends or breaks.            

190
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,157
measurements are displayed on a screen.           

191
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,995
in the 1930s, basic force gauges        

192
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:14,333
were attached to cranes to measure a product's strength.            

193
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,135
today's force testers are high-tech.          

194
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:22,407
they have digital displays and computerized controls.    

195
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,343
an assembler starts by screwing brackets       

196
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:28,680
into a steel base for the main computer board.   

197
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,416
the computer board comes next.  

198
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,551
he uses nuts, called standoffs,           

199
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,754
to raise it above the steel plate.      

200
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,024
this creates an air space between the two,         

201
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,893
preventing electrical shorting.            

202
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,029
throughout the assembly, the technician          

203
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:47,699
wears an electrostatic discharge band on his wrist.   

204
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,903
this arrests static electricity to prevent damage to the parts.             

205
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,440
he screws the motor drive board              

206
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,975
to the force tester base     

207
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,644
and moves on to the next batch of parts.     

208
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,646
they include the power supply board,          

209
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,848
a mechanism to turn the unit on,               

210
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,518
and an emergency stop assembly.            

211
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,653
he routes the wires for the power switches      

212
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,822
and installs the push buttons.        

213
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,062
he connects a ribbon cable to the main circuit board.    

214
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,733
then, he attaches the other end of the cable           

215
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,702
to the motor drive board.    

216
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,404
this allows them to communicate.          

217
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:30,108
finally, he completes the power supply connections.  

218
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,279
another member of the team    

219
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,147
assembles a vertical support rail     

220
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,216
to an aluminum base.       

221
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,953
this rail is the backbone of the tester.          

222
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,956
it supports the force arm and the track it moves on.    

223
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,395
he attaches the track to the support rail.       

224
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:53,899
using an alignment tool,     

225
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,968
he slides the shuttle      
into the grooves of the track,  

226
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,571
then confirms it moves freely.  

227
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,748
he's ready to mount the force arm to the shuttle.  

228
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,453
a long, threaded rod, known as a lead screw,      

229
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,488
is fastened to the force arm.  

230
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,328
the lead screw rotates,     

231
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,866
allowing the force arm to move up and down.       

232
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,069
he lowers an aluminum cover over the force arm assembly   

233
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,004
and secures it to the base.   

234
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,540
one side of the casing is open.              

235
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:40,344
he'll install an accordion-style rubber curtain to it later.   

236
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,881
next, he threads a rubber belt around a pulley,         

237
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:47,352
which is attached to the end of the lead screw.        

238
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,155
he installs the motor and wraps the other end     

239
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,557
of the rubber belt around the motor pulley.     

240
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,029
the motor drive assembly turns the lead screw       

241
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,731
to move the force arm.      

242
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,037
the base is now mounted with the electronics       

243
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,639
to the force tester frame.    

244
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,512
after connecting switches that limit            

245
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,982
the force arm's range of movement,        

246
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,516
he installs an encoder on the motor           

247
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,521
to provide feedback on speed and power.       

248
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:26,224
the electronics are covered with a tough plastic casing.   

249
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,061
next up is a slotted table.   

250
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,267
he clips a computer tablet to the tester.          

251
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,468
an adjustable bracket is attached,           

252
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,537
which is used for changing the screen's position      

253
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,540
as desired.           

254
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,609
a force tester doesn't just bear down on things.       

255
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,012
it also pulls things apart.   

256
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,947
a technician conducts a pull test           

257
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,484
on a piece of nylon cord.    

258
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,219
he activates the force arm.   

259
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,789
the force arm pulls the cord as it grips the base.      

260
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,426
the tester measures the peak force required     

261
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,496
to pull the cord apart.     

262
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,933
the results are displayed instantly on the control screen.             

263
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,970
there are different force testers          

264
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,506
for different applications.   

265
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,576
but the purpose is always the same --      

266
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,880
pull and compress objects    
in order to test their limits.  

267
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,764
272               

268
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,069
narrator: one of the ways    

269
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,604
a manufacturer can package a product      

270
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,006
is in a composite can.      

271
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,609
it's a cylindrical container made of cardboard        

272
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,411
with a moisture barrier lining.             

273
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,080
composite cans are less expensive to produce  

274
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,149
than glass or metal containers.       

275
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,651
and they're recyclable.     

276
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,156
many products are packaged in composite cans,        

277
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,824
everything from automotive grease      

278
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,960
to parmesan cheese.       

279
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,297
the cans are cardboard with an interior lining     

280
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,033
that prevents it from absorbing moisture.     

281
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,036
the top can be a sifter, a pull-tab cap,         

282
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,906
a ring and plug, or peel-off foil.        

283
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,441
to make composite cans,     

284
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,843
they begin winding a strip of thin paper      

285
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,314
over a long steel rod, called a mandrel.        

286
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:32,350
the machine applies glue to the top of the strip.     

287
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,325
simultaneously, two strips of cardboard wind off rolls   

288
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,861
and pass over a glue applicator,           

289
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:45,430
which coats their underside with adhesive.          

290
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,934
then these overlapping twin strips           

291
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,271
wind around the coated paper-wrapped mandrel.      

292
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,274
the adhesive binds the layers,  

293
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,476
producing a two-ply cardboard tube     

294
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,745
with an interior moistureproof lining.      

295
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:05,016
the machine pushes the tube off the mandrel         

296
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,552
to an automated circular saw.  

297
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,222
the saw cuts the tube into shorter pieces.       

298
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,490
they fall into a bin,      

299
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,892
which feeds the labeling machine.      

300
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,562
suction cups pick up the sheet of labels       

301
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,764
and run it over a glue roller.  

302
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,968
it applies adhesive to the back side.        

303
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,969
a vacuum carpet carries the label        

304
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,172
onto another set of mandrels.  

305
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:30,307
the machine slips the tube onto the mandrel,        

306
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,311
then wraps the label around the tube.         

307
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,580
next, knives cut the spinning tube        

308
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,315
into seven cans.         

309
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,188
the can-making line       
has been slowed by our camera.  

310
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,392
at the regular output speed of 250 cans per minute,     

311
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,396
all you'd see is a blur.     

312
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,864
a pusher moves the cans     

313
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,666
toward a device called an upender,        

314
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,235
which stands each can upright.  

315
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,208
the cans then spin through a gluer,      

316
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,444
which applies a bead      
of adhesive along the top rim.  

317
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:15,353
meanwhile, another station lines up the closures in single file.              

318
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,889
these cans are for parmesan cheese,     

319
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:21,826
so the tops are plastic sifters.            

320
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,429
they go one by one onto a carousel.         

321
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,099
the tops align with cans on another carousel       

322
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,668
with perfect timing.       

323
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,973
a plunger pushes the top about a 1/2 inch         

324
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,343
into the glued rim of the can.  

325
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,517
as the cans exit the machine,  

326
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,086
a conveyer turns them upside down.     

327
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,191
the cans reach the end of the line,           

328
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,061
where workers stack them on shipping pallets.       

329
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,733
the parmesan cheese producer  
will receive them like this --  

330
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,069
open end up, ready for filling.            

331
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,875
to make the metal bottom for the can,           

332
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,411
a punch press stamps circles out of a strip of tin  

333
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,214
that's been coated with a food-safe lacquer.    

334
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,684
the gold-colored coating prevents the tin from rusting  

335
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,122
when it comes into contact with the moisture in the cheese.             

336
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,027
the next machine uses forming rollers       

337
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,663
to shape the rim that will grip the can.     

338
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,370
this production line is making composite cans     

339
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,239
for grease cartridges.      

340
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,976
mechanics use them in a device similar to a caulking gun.    

341
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,377
for this product,        

342
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,447
the cardboard tube has a plastic-coated liner.   

343
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,985
the liner is heat-sealed to the cardboard         

344
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,254
to prevent grease from leaking out.        

345
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,592
the closure is a rigid aluminum top     

346
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,594
that you remove with a pull tab.              

347
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,863
this machine, called a seamer,  

348
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:08,066
crimps the metal edge tightly around the can's rim.      

349
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,337
as the cans exit the machine,  

350
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,539
a computer takes measurements of each top.              

351
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,742
if it doesn't meet specifications,         

352
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,044
the machine ejects the can from the line.          

353
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,015
the cans that pass inspection  

354
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,417
continue on to the packaging area,      

355
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,487
where an employee does one last visual inspection           

356
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,157
before shipping to the grease manufacturer.   

357
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,963
once a composite can is empty,  

358
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,432
the cardboard can be separated from the metal     

359
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,169
and tossed into a recycling bin.
