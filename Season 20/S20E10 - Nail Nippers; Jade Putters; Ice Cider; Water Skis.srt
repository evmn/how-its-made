00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,187
            narrator:           
       an 1880s invention,      

2
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,190
        the cast-iron tub       
  was first marketed in america 

3
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,726
       as a horse trough        
       and a hog scalder,       

4
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,195
     which could also serve     
          as a bathtub.         

5
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,666
   it was soon more popular in  
 the bathroom than the barnyard.

6
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,400
 it's heat-retaining properties 

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,337
 made a long and luxurious soak 
            possible.           

8
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,077
        the cast-iron tub       
        is one invention        

9
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,146
   that's got a lot of people   
          in hot water,         

10
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:22,615
   and that's what people like  
            about it.           

11
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,487
 today, they make cast-iron tubs
       from scrap metal --      

12
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,289
             things             
   like old heating radiators,  

13
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,528
  water pipes, manhole covers,  
    and even some car parts.    

14
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,966
      recycling scrap iron      

15
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:43,336
    is more energy efficient    
   and cheaper than mining it.  

16
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,974
        a powerful magnet       
    at the end of a crane arm   

17
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,509
      lifts the heavy iron      
      from the scrap heap       

18
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,644
        and transfers it        

19
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,380
          to big trays          
     known as charging pans.    

20
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,919
    the charging pans deliver   
  the scrap to a center trough. 

21
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,387
     this trough is a scale.    

22
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:04,423
       it weighs the scrap      
 and releases it to a conveyer. 

23
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,130
         the scrap heads        
    into the bathtub factory.   

24
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,067
    inside, it flows directly   

25
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,870
        into an enormous        
   electric induction furnace   

26
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:22,674
             heated             
 to more than 2,500° fahrenheit.

27
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:27,279
      the scrap iron melts      
  into a pool of liquid metal.  

28
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,751
      they run this furnace     
        around the clock,       

29
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,819
 and it's always two-thirds full

30
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,255
    so that newly-added scrap   
         melts quickly.         

31
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,627
  huge hydraulic cylinders tip  
      the furnace forward.      

32
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,430
      the molten iron flows     
          into a ladle.         

33
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,172
       an overhead trolley      

34
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,841
   carries the ladle brimming   
   with the hot liquid metal    

35
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,377
      to a holding furnace      
 which maintains its temperature

36
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,913
      until the next step.      

37
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,581
        they're now ready       

38
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,917
 to make a two-part casting mold
            from sand           

39
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,786
    using steel tub patterns.   

40
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:10,389
  to make one half of the mold, 
     they fill a tub pattern    

41
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,991
           with a mix           
     of moist sand and clay.    

42
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,327
  hydraulic rams pack it down,  

43
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,196
      and the mix compacts      

44
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,064
       and takes the shape      
         of the pattern.        

45
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,466
  the clay is the bonding agent 

46
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,602
           that causes          
   the mix to hold the shape.   

47
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:24,837
     once the rams retract,     

48
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,139
      the mold takes a trip     
        under some blades       

49
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,475
that scrape off the excess sand.

50
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,212
 machinery then lifts this half 
        of the sand mold        

51
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,947
    out of the steel pattern    
        and transfers it        

52
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,517
  to the other half of the mold 
        prepared earlier.       

53
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,889
      the two bathtub molds     
       now come together,       

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,692
       leaving a small gap      
          between them.         

55
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,163
        the molten iron,        
   which has been transferred   

56
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,764
 to an automatic pouring system,

57
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,300
       flows into portals       
     in the top of the mold     

58
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,569
 and into the gap at the center.

59
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,439
        the bathtub molds       
  then move to a cooling line,  

60
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,108
     and after chilling here    
      for about 20 minutes,     

61
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,578
   the iron inside solidifies.  

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,182
then, it's into a shaker device 
that breaks apart the sand mold,

63
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,319
            revealing           
  the newly cast iron bathtub.  

64
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,925
  a robot retrieves the bathtub 
         and stacks it.         

65
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,464
        next, an employee       

66
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,134
   sprays specially-formulated  
          glass powder          

67
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,401
          onto the tub.         

68
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,804
        it's an undercoat       
     for the enamel finish.     

69
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,807
        they bake the tub       
       until it's red-hot.      

70
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,274
          in the heat,          

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,479
     the glass powder melts     
  and adheres to the iron tub.  

72
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,215
       a hydraulic device       
      called a manipulator      

73
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,217
   sets the tub on a pedestal.  

74
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,019
      the pedestal swivels      

75
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,156
          as they apply         
  two more ground-glass layers. 

76
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,691
 these are the enamel topcoats. 

77
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:56,428
  on contact, the glass mixture 
    melts onto the undercoat.   

78
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,031
       the layers of glass      
      form a permanent bond     

79
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,266
     with the iron casting.     

80
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,102
  between coats, the tub cools, 

81
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,573
      and they send it back     
 into the furnace for a reheat. 

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,578
        they place a mask       
 in the base of the enamel tub. 

83
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,247
   the mask is like a stencil.  

84
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,650
       a robot blasts fine      
     alumina-oxide particles    

85
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,186
into the open areas of the mask.

86
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,123
 this etches an abrasive finish,

87
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,525
    leaving a subtle pattern    
 on the surface of the bathtub. 

88
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,128
   it creates visual interest   

89
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,332
        and also provides       
       a non-slip surface.      

90
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:38,070
   the masks come in a variety  
of patterns for different looks.

91
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,938
  whether it's a modern design  

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,274
       or the traditional       
         claw-foot one,         

93
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:46,712
these cast-iron tubs should have
   no problem finding a home.   

94
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,932
       narrator: the hopi,      
     a native american tribe    

95
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,635
        living primarily        
    in northeastern arizona,    

96
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,570
 are known for carving kachinas,

97
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,973
          wooden dolls          
      representing deities,     

98
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:17,242
       elements in nature,      
  or the spirits of ancestors.  

99
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,844
they are traditionally presented
       in a dance ceremony      

100
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,814
 to the girls of the community. 

101
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,987
       hopi kachina dolls       
 are cherished family keepsakes 

102
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:31,991
 designed to teach hopi children
  about the deities and spirits 

103
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:35,127
             central            
 to their aboriginal traditions.

104
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,262
  besides ceremonial purposes,  

105
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,165
    many hopi carvers produce   
          kachina dolls         

106
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,035
            for sale            
   to native art enthusiasts.   

107
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,809
         the carver uses        
   knives of different sizes,   

108
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,478
  sharpening the steel blades   
  after every 10 or 15 minutes  

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,282
       to prevent dulling.      

110
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,219
 kachina dolls are traditionally
      made of cottonwood --     

111
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,689
   not from the tree's branch,  
       but from its root.       

112
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:10,095
the carver begins by shaving off
      the thin outer bark.      

113
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,964
       with a straight cut      
   from one side to the other,  

114
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,233
            he shapes           
   a bit of the single feather  

115
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,836
    which will adorn the top    
      of this doll's head.      

116
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,375
            he makes            
    a series of vertical cuts   

117
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,644
 to form the face and hairline. 

118
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,715
      he continues carving      
         the head form,         

119
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,718
 then, with a wood-burning tool,

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,587
   burns in the square outline  
          of the face.          

121
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,524
     now he shaves away wood    
         above and below        

122
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,460
   to make the face protrude.   

123
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,863
        he forms the face       
        in more detail...       

124
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,735
        ...then picks up        
  the wood-burning tool again,  

125
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,172
     this time to delineate     
         the neckline...        

126
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,910
     ...and the doll's robe.    

127
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,752
        back to carving.        

128
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,753
    now, with upward strokes,   

129
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:14,292
       he shaves off wood       
     to shape the neckline.     

130
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,761
     he takes a larger knife    

131
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,763
           and removes          
      bigger pieces of wood     

132
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,366
        to finish forming       
        the head feather.       

133
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,300
      now he sands the wood     

134
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,103
    with progressively finer    
           sandpapers           

135
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:27,172
   to remove all the cut marks  
       left by his knives       

136
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,374
 and to refine the doll's shape.

137
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,843
          with the doll         
      perfectly formed now,     

138
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,713
    it's time for the details   
        and decorations.        

139
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,950
  first, he sketches it all out 
          in pencil...          

140
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,490
  ...then runs the wood-burning 
      tool along the lines.     

141
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,331
     he decorates the body,     

142
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,068
then moves on to the doll's hair
      and facial features.      

143
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,539
       it's these details       
   that bring the doll alive.   

144
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,432
 what was a simple and ordinary 
      cottonwood tree root      

145
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,435
    has gone through carving,   
      sanding, and burning      

146
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,972
            to become           
an almost-finished kachina doll.

147
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:37,576
 he now coats the entire surface
       with clear varnish.      

148
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,177
       this seals the wood      

149
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,048
  to prevent it from absorbing  
   the paint he applies next.   

150
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,450
     about 40 minutes later,    

151
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,520
       the varnish is dry       
   and the painting can begin.  

152
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,124
   traditionally, hopi carvers  
made paint from natural pigments

153
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,326
      such as sand, plants,     
          and berries.          

154
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:59,731
       today's carvers buy      
  ready-made oils or acrylics.  

155
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,067
       this carver dilutes      
    acrylic paint with water    

156
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,468
     to make it transparent.    

157
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,404
 this allows the natural beauty 
        of the wood grain       

158
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,006
   to show through the color.   

159
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:16,481
   after painting, he applies   
     a coat of clear varnish    

160
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,951
to seal and protect the surface.

161
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:25,224
some carvers have moved in a new
  artistic direction -- bronze. 

162
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:29,895
  they use their wooden kachina 
  doll to produce a latex mold. 

163
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,298
      then, with this mold,     
       cast a wax replica.      

164
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,367
      they dip the replica      
         in a substance         

165
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,703
          that hardens          
  into a heat-resistant shell.  

166
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:41,373
   then, they put the shell in  
 a furnace to melt away the wax.

167
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,375
      this leaves a cavity      
    in the shape of the doll.   

168
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,179
     they poor molten bronze    
        into the cavity,        

169
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,314
       and when the bronze      
      cools and solidifies,     

170
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,184
      they break the shell      
   to extract a bronze version  

171
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,386
     of their kachina doll.     

172
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,988
       instead of paints,       

173
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,056
      they apply chemicals      
     that color the metal --    

174
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:02,161
         a modern twist         
     on an age-old hopi art.    

175
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,342
            narrator:           
 a mine-truck engine is a beast.

176
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,612
   the most powerful ones pack  
     a brawny 24 cylinders,     

177
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,749
  generating 4,200 horsepower.  

178
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,484
 compare that to 200 horsepower 

179
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,953
       for a mid-sized car      
       with six cylinders.      

180
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,222
       but when they start      
       to show the strain,      

181
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:33,091
 it's time for a total rebuild. 

182
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:39,164
    after about 20,000 hours    
     of hauling heavy rock,     

183
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,832
     it's time for renewal.     

184
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,236
       mine-truck engines       
    are routinely rebuilt --    

185
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,172
         not just once,         
       but numerous times.      

186
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,242
          it's cheaper          
    than buying a new engine,   

187
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,644
and it saves precious resources.

188
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:56,514
          each rebuild          
   is a massive undertaking --  

189
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,518
    virtually every component   
      of this diesel engine     

190
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,388
     will be remanufactured     
          or replaced.          

191
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,857
   as the team dismantles it,   

192
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,194
     they inspect each part     
       for wear and tear.       

193
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,664
        they take it down       
   to the immense crankshaft,   

194
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,200
            the heart           
   of this mine-truck engine.   

195
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,670
  with the crankshaft removed,  

196
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:23,141
 they pull the lengthy camshaft 
   out of the cylinder block.   

197
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,744
 with the engine now in pieces, 

198
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,945
      they clean every part     
       that's salvageable,      

199
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,415
            including           
    the huge cylinder block.    

200
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,219
  a couple of hours soaking in  
 a hot sodium-phosphate solution

201
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,355
       removes the grease       
   and exposes the bare metal.  

202
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,092
        any imperfections       
     are now more apparent.     

203
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,027
      using a depth gauge,      

204
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,630
  a technician maps out flaws,  
        like this crack.        

205
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:49,834
   it will need to be filled,   
   and he makes a note of it.   

206
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,104
              next,             
    a high-speed milling tool   

207
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,373
     carves off a thin layer    
          of the steel,         

208
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,842
   taking the cylinder block's  
     finish from grimy-gray     

209
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,578
      to bright and shiny.      

210
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
      it also smoothes away     
         any unevenness         

211
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,716
   to create a uniform surface  

212
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:08,387
       for sealing gaskets      
   around the cylinders later.  

213
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,322
 after the intensive machining, 

214
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,924
       the cylinder block       
         looks like new.        

215
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,260
it's back to the crankshaft now.

216
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,063
     it, too, has undergone     
     an extensive cleaning.     

217
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,465
        machinery grinds        
      the outside diameter      

218
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,933
    to a precise tolerance --   

219
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,602
   equivalent to one-twentieth  
        of a human hair.        

220
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:29,141
      this will allow new,      
 thicker bearings to fit to it. 

221
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,680
     the team clamps weights    
   to the machine crankshaft.   

222
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,616
       these weights mimic      
    the load of engine parts,   

223
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,018
     like pistons and rods,     

224
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,355
       as they now balance      
       this critical part.      

225
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,090
     the crankshaft rotates,    

226
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:49,094
  and sensors detect vibrations 
    and pinpoint the problem.   

227
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,097
       after more grinding      
       in these locations,      

228
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:56,435
  they test it again to confirm 
   the crankshaft is balanced.  

229
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,438
   back to the camshaft now --  

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,506
      a member of the crew      
      uses a black marker       

231
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,974
   to highlight wear patterns.  

232
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,976
  a grinder evens out the wear, 

233
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,846
      and it also machines      
    the profile of each lobe    

234
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,248
          as it follows         
    a metal camshaft master.    

235
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,386
  the black-marker lines vanish 
 as the wear lines are smoothed,

236
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,390
 and the profile of the camshaft
          is improved.          

237
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:22,327
        a major clean-up        
    also transforms the rods    

238
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,063
          that connect          
  the piston to the crankshaft. 

239
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,667
a technician then places the rod
   in a special honing machine  

240
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,403
        and activates it.       

241
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:36,074
   four arms with gritty ends   
grind the inside of the rod-head

242
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,878
 as the technician moves the rod
         back and forth.        

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,613
  this sizes the inner diameter 
        to enable the rod       

244
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,017
             to fit             
  to the other revamped parts.  

245
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,821
       once all the parts       
 have been cleaned and machined,

246
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:53,492
       the engine is ready      
         for reassembly.        

247
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,627
   using a crane, a technician  
      lowers the crankshaft     

248
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,764
  back into the cylinder block. 

249
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,833
    he secures the crankshaft   
           at one end           

250
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,102
      with a metal bracket      
       called a main cap.       

251
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,572
       there are actually       
    nine main caps in total.    

252
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,574
 he gives the crankshaft a spin 

253
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,109
           to confirm           
     that it rotates freely     

254
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,912
   before installing the rest.  

255
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,382
   with a piston now attached   
 to one end of a connecting rod,

256
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,784
     he slides the other end    
           into a slot          

257
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,319
     in the cylinder block.     

258
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,389
     this particular engine     
     is a 16-cylinder one.      

259
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,125
     it's considered midsize    
       for mining trucks.       

260
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,529
once the gaskets have been fixed
     to the cylinder block,     

261
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,866
            they bolt           
    the cylinder heads to it.   

262
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,269
   there are hundreds of parts  
in one of these monster engines,

263
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,174
  and it takes 700 person hours 
        for one rebuild.        

264
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,546
   with this mine-truck engine  
      now fully assembled,      

265
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:52,818
they hook it up to a dynamometer
 to measure engine performance. 

266
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,354
they run at full tilt to confirm
 that it's firing all cylinders 

267
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:01,092
   and performing to the max.   

268
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,428
 this rebuilt mine-truck engine 

269
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,363
         is ready to go         
       back into service.       

270
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,900
    strong and heavily built,   
   this nine-ton diesel engine  

271
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,870
   should pull its own weight   
         and then some.         

272
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,585
            narrator:           
music, photographs, documents --

273
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,788
what used to take up shelf space
      in our homes offices      

274
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,291
        can now be stored       
      on a tiny memory card     

275
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,193
         or flash drive.        

276
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,795
 you can save your files on it, 

277
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,731
  take them out of the device   
  and transport them anywhere,  

278
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,667
     as well as delete data     
       you no longer need.      

279
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:50,008
 a memory card fits into a slot 
     in your digital device.    

280
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,611
       a flash drive plugs      
        into a usb port.        

281
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,146
       the key component        
       of both formats --       

282
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,414
         a memory chip,         

283
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,849
      produced in a factory     

284
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,686
   that's 1,000 times cleaner   
 than a hospital operating room.

285
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,291
 it all begins with the wafer --
  a thin disc of pure silicon,  

286
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:10,161
 a non-metallic natural element 
   that conducts electricity.   

287
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,430
  an automated container system 

288
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,767
     moves the wafer through    
    more than 800 operations.   

289
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,968
          at each stop,         

290
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,638
       the wafer receives       
      one of several layers     

291
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,774
  of non-conductive materials,  
    such as silicon dioxide,    

292
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,644
    and conductive materials,   
         such as copper.        

293
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,046
   the machines coat the layer  
   with light-sensitive fluid,  

294
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,183
       then apply uv light      
     through a glass stencil    

295
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,520
     of the complex pattern     
    of electrical circuitry.    

296
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,255
   the exposed areas of fluid   
        chemically react,       

297
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,659
      locking the material      
      directly underneath       

298
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,794
   into the circuitry pattern.  

299
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:46,731
 chemical baths then remove the 
 surrounding fluid and material,

300
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,000
             leaving            
  only the layer of circuitry,  

301
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,469
      electrical pathways       
      2,000 times narrower      

302
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,672
       than a human hair.       

303
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:59,144
 a robot tests the circuitry for
 every memory chip on the wafer.

304
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:02,813
         a single wafer,        
measuring 12 inches in diameter,

305
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,016
yields hundreds of memory chips.

306
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,686
 the goal is to make those chips
      as small as possible.     

307
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,755
        in this industry,       

308
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,692
  it's all about maximum memory 
        in minimal space.       

309
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,293
 that's why this operation thins
            the chips           

310
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,030
        by grinding away        
    two-thirds of the silicon   

311
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,232
 from the backside of the wafer.

312
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,301
        and one last step       
    before cutting the wafer    

313
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,304
 into individual memory chips --

314
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,239
    this machine applies tape   

315
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,109
             to hold            
  the separated chips together. 

316
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,516
  a computer-guided saw slices  
        the chips apart.        

317
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,118
         cutting silicon        
    is like cutting glass --    

318
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,288
           it requires          
      a diamond-edge blade.     

319
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,262
in the next step, a robotic arm,

320
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,731
     following the wafer map    
       generated earlier,       

321
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,000
       picks up the chips       
       which pass testing       

322
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,237
      and attaches each one     
   to a fiberglass lead frame.  

323
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,675
      the term lead refers      
      to the frame's pins,      

324
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,778
     which connect the chip     
     to the digital device.     

325
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,418
  another robot wires the chip  
        to the lead frame       

326
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,821
  with gold thread that's about 
   the width of a human hair.   

327
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,092
    gold is very conductive,    
 so now the pathway is complete.

328
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,561
     electricity will travel    
   from the chip's circuitry,   

329
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:27,832
    through the gold thread,    
   to the pins, to the device.  

330
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,769
      after a machine seals     
      the chip in plastic,      

331
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,771
 workers gently snap them apart 

332
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:35,573
         and insert them        
    in memory-card housings.    

333
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,377
  the plastic and metal housing 
   is for a memory card format  

334
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,380
     known as compact flash.    

335
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,381
    a small, automated press    

336
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,052
      locks the two halves      
    of the housing together.    

337
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:52,223
     the next station labels    
    the front of the housing.   

338
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,129
    every single memory card    
        undergoes testing       

339
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,266
  for both function and speed.  

340
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,202
         a laser machine        
   etches product information   

341
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,938
  into the back of the housing. 

342
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,375
    these are another format    
  called secure digital, or sd. 

343
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,011
  they're assembled and labeled 

344
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,682
            just like           
     the compact flashcards.    

345
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,752
 when the finished memory cards 
   come off the assembly line,  

346
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:24,955
         workers conduct        
   a final, visual inspection.  

347
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,292
       on the flash drive       
         assembly line,         

348
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,227
     much the same process.     

349
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:34,766
   a robot puts 20 lead frames  
      on 20 circuit boards.     

350
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,635
    then, a worker positions    
       20 usb connectors,       

351
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,139
 which a soldering machine bonds
     to the circuit boards.     

352
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,778
        the final step --       
       electronic testing,      

353
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,913
          to make sure          
 the usb connection is working, 

354
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,250
   and via the circuit board,   
      talking to the chip.      

355
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,991
 the flash drives are now ready 
 to go into individual housings.

356
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,661
         this model has         
   a two-part plastic housing,  

357
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,730
     which pivots in and out    
       of a plastic case,       

358
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,000
      that can conveniently     
   be attached to a key chain   

359
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,602
          or a lanyard          
      for easy portability.     

360
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,006
   flash drive or memory card,  

361
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:18,476
  storing your digital effects  
      is just a click away.
