00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,920
narrator: while the pill bottle
isn't yet passé,        

4
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:57,523
we're seeing many medications being sold in blister packs -- 

5
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,860
those cards on which each pill is lined up in a row 

6
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:02,795
and encased in a packaging bubble.     

7
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,263
to take your medication, you simply press the blister  

8
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,734
and push out the pill through the breakable backing. 

9
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,873
blister packaging prevents moisture and air   

10
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,076
from coming into contact with the medicine.       

11
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,745
the package is comprised of two layers -- 

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,548
typically, an aluminum foil sheet called the lidding    

13
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,819
and a pvc plastic sheet with rows of blisters.     

14
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,755
once the manufacturer designs the packaging format,     

15
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,290
the engineering department   

16
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,759
tailor-makes the tools to produce it.         

17
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,162
this computer-guided mill creates the die        

18
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:39,398
that will form the blisters in the pvc sheet.       

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,837
they mount the die on a machine
called a thermoformer.     

20
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,439
as the pvc sheet enters the machine,      

21
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,743
an oven heats it up, making it soft and malleable. 

22
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:57,315
the die then strikes it,    

23
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,985
imprinting the pattern of circles.    

24
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,922
a split second after the forming station closes,  

25
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:07,259
a blast of air forms the circles
into raised blisters.     

26
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,929
refrigerated plates then sandwich the sheet,    

27
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,864
setting the new shape.     

28
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,401
the pills arrive at the packaging facility   

29
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,737
in bulk containers.      

30
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,474
workers sift off any pill dust that may have formed,     

31
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:25,010
give the pills a preliminary inspection,   

32
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,413
then load them into a large hopper.      

33
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:30,482
if they were shipped with   
any moisture-absorption packets,

34
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,386
an employee now removes and discards them. 

35
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,624
the hopper feeds the packaging machine.  

36
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,626
the blister sheets move through
open side up          

37
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,228
so that the pills fall right in.

38
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,963
rotating brushes and paddles  

39
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,833
dispense the pills into the passing cavities,   

40
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,604
which are designed to fit no more than one pill per blister.

41
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,044
an inspector fills any empty blisters    

42
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,112
while a sophisticated vision system         

43
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,514
detects any broken or chipped pills,  

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,917
flagging them to be rejected later.     

45
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,191
the blisters enter a seal station,     

46
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,627
where they're mated with the foil lidding.     

47
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,531
one side of the lidding    

48
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,533
is printed beforehand with product information.   

49
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,469
to make the printing plate,  

50
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,906
technicians mount a blank rubber mat on a cylinder.   

51
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,010
as the cylinder revolves,   

52
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,679
a powerful laser cuts away at the rubber    

53
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,814
until the information to be printed         

54
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,950
appears in raised lettering,  

55
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,286
just like a traditional rubber stamp.  

56
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,821
they transfer this rubber plate

57
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,489
to the packaging line's printing station,       

58
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,425
where the rubber plate picks up ink          

59
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,093
and rolls it onto the lidding. 

60
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,461
the ink dries         

61
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,563
by the time the lidding reaches the sealing station,  

62
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,966
where lidding and blister sheet meet.    

63
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:02,040
the next station simultaneously
applies pressure and heat.   

64
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,109
this activates an adhesive on the lidding,  

65
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,711
heat-sealing the sheets together.           

66
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,851
then, refrigerated plates cool the surfaces       

67
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,653
to set the adhesive.      

68
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,656
here a die punches the hole  

69
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,658
through which the blister pack will lock   

70
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,528
into a childproof case.    

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,732
then another die punches the individual blister packs apart.

72
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,734
vacuum arms transfer the packs to a single-file conveyer belt,

73
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,670
dropping any packs       

74
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,673
which the vision system identified for rejection.   

75
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,678
this automated arm sets childproof cases on a track  

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,946
moving in parallel       

77
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,616
to the conveyer that holds the blister packs. 

78
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,551
then a loading arm       

79
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,621
slides a blister pack into each plastic case,    

80
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,624
mating the hole in the pack to the case's internal lock.  

81
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,830
finally, an applicator places an adhesive label,   

82
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,364
bearing all the required    

83
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,300
identification and safety information     

84
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,836
onto each passing case.    

85
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:10,509
random samples undergo a series
of quality-control checks.   

86
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,045
in this test for water- and air-tightness, 

87
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,715
technicians submerge the blister pack in blue dye  

88
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,717
and apply a vacuum.      

89
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,319
any dye penetrating the pack  

90
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,521
would indicate a hole in a blister      

91
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,491
or a flaw in the seal     
between the plastic and lidding.

92
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,131
should a particular medication require extra protection,   

93
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,999
the blister pack can, for example,          

94
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,068
be made of light-resistant materials           

95
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,104
or contain an extra moisture barrier.   

96
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,490
narrator: invented in holland in 1898, the deli slicer    

97
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,293
launched a revolution behind the meat counter.    

98
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,028
no longer was it necessary   

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,097
to carve meats and cheeses entirely by hand.       

100
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,633
with a turn of a crank,    

101
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:11,070
the deli slicer produced precise cuts in a jiffy.    

102
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,044
the modern deli slicer is powered by electricity,   

103
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,446
with a manual override for the carriage        

104
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,782
that delivers food to a spinning blade.      

105
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,724
production begins with a cast aluminum base.   

106
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,993
a worker installs a cam mechanism        

107
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,595
that is part of a system    

108
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,998
for adjusting the thickness of the slice.  

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,601
he threads wiring, connected to an on/off indicator light, 

110
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,003
through holes in the base.   

111
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,406
then he screws an index knob onto the shaft         

112
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,109
protruding from the cam mechanism installed earlier.  

113
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:56,882
an important warning label comes next.          

114
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:00,485
then he seals the gap around the blade shaft with silicone 

115
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,489
and removes the excess with soapy water.       

116
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,560
next up is the wiring for the slicer motor.     

117
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,962
she clamps the wires together 

118
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,299
and bolts the clamps to    
the inside of the aluminum base.

119
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:20,705
she inserts the on/off switch and the plastic trim,     

120
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,509
then attaches a device that will slide        

121
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:27,246
to adjust the gap between the gauge plate and the blade, 

122
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,815
thereby controlling the thickness of the cut.   

123
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,386
the deli slicer is ready    

124
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,855
for the slide rod and carriage sub assembly   

125
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,191
that will deliver food to the spinning blade.     

126
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,461
the carriage will move across a track         

127
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,331
that she now attaches to the lip of the base.    

128
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:51,003
she tests the carriage assembly
to confirm that it's on track. 

129
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,206
the next worker        

130
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,210
secures the blade motor to the wiring with bolts.   

131
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:02,681
he connects the motor to the blade shaft with a drive belt. 

132
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,685
operating the motor allows him to observe     

133
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,954
the drive belt and pulleys in action,           

134
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,323
confirming that they operate smoothly.           

135
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,627
once the gauge plate is installed,         

136
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,063
they move on to making the blade.      

137
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,767
computer-guided cutters slope the steel surface    

138
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,904
and carve a precise bevel onto the rim.         

139
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,375
it goes from a rough blank   

140
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,512
to a precisely shaped blade in just minutes.        

141
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,249
the next worker etches the   
company logo and production date

142
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,452
into the blade metal.     

143
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,854
another lathe pre-sharpens the blade     

144
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,923
to the point where it could cut through something 

145
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,292
as fine as several thousandths of an inch.          

146
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,002
a worker slides the blade onto the drive shaft      

147
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,039
and secures it in place with a nut.          

148
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,744
he now checks the alignment of the gauge plate       

149
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,813
in relation to the blade.   

150
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,548
he turns the thickness mechanism
to close the gap        

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,284
and checks it again.      

152
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,819
with a dial indicator,     

153
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,822
he measures the position of the blade even more precisely. 

154
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,223
this tool confirms       

155
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,559
that the blade is in the exact position for cutting 

156
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,962
and that it won't lose that position once activated. 

157
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,165
this deli slicer comes with its own sharpening system,   

158
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,169
a grinding wheel in protective casing.     

159
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,437
he mounts the grinder and activates it        

160
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,040
to hone the edge to razor-sharpness.      

161
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,777
when the blade cuts through tissue paper cleanly, 

162
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,413
it's ready for real slicing action.    

163
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,885
a worker screws the arm for the
sliding tray to the carriage. 

164
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,323
he uses a spacer disc to establish the correct distance 

165
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,593
between the food tray and the blade.         

166
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,662
he sets the food tray on the arm

167
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,398
and checks the gap between it and the blade.   

168
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,801
once the two are correctly aligned,     

169
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,335
he removes the spacer     

170
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,206
and latches the safety guard to the blade.         

171
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,276
and now for a test, verifying that the tray doesn't drag   

172
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,946
or scrape against the blade guard.    

173
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:18,750
below, they've installed rods to
move the carriage on the track. 

174
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,819
the system can be manually operated       

175
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,887
or driven by a second motor.  

176
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,959
finally, a worker cleans the  
slicing machine until it gleams.

177
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,630
at 135 pounds, this deli slicer
is no lightweight,       

178
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,734
so they use a crane to lower it
into the packing box.     

179
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,236
hefty and heavy duty,     

180
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,905
this deli slicer should have what it takes   

181
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,076
to cut it at the meat market. 

182
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,658
narrator: oysters are a versatile shellfish.   

183
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,594
you can bake them, boil them, smoke them,     

184
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,263
or eat them raw right from the shell.     

185
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,200
over the years,        
wild oyster stocks have declined

186
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,202
due to overfishing and pollution.         

187
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:15,874
so today, 95% of the oysters we
consume come from oyster farms.

188
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,678
oysters are filter feeders,  

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,080
meaning they draw seawater over their gills        

190
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,149
to trap and eat the phytoplankton --      

191
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,152
microscopic aquatic organisms. 

192
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,887
an adult oyster can filter   

193
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,823
more than five quarts of seawater per hour.     

194
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:35,493
oyster farms are located in or by the sea        

195
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,897
because the oysters need to feed
off seawater to survive.    

196
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,566
the hatchery keeps the oysters in upwellers --        

197
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,103
mesh-bottom buckets sitting in seawater.      

198
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,506
oysters can reproduce once they're six months old.  

199
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:51,910
however, the ideal breeding age
is between two and 10 years.  

200
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:56,181
at breeding time, workers put 
the oysters into breeding trays,

201
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,851
oscillating the temperature between 68° and 86°      

202
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,720
to stimulate spawning.     

203
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:05,923
the females squirt out eggs, the males squirt out semen,   

204
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,595
and 16 hours later, the fertilized eggs hatch larvae. 

205
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,265
right from birth, the oysters feed        

206
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,468
on a blend of the phytoplankton
they'd eat in the wild.    

207
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,805
the hatchery dilutes this plankton mix in seawater 

208
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,207
and pumps it to the oyster containers.   

209
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,743
marine biologists manage the ponds        

210
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,880
in which the hatchery grows its phytoplankton supply.

211
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,351
the larvae are so tiny,    
you can't see them in the water.

212
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:35,620
they're visible only under a microscope.    

213
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,222
right from the time they hatch,

214
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,424
they already have a shell and can swim.         

215
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,758
by about the two-week mark,  

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
they've grown to the size of a speck,    

217
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,430
about 1/64 of an inch long.  

218
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:50,369
however, now they act like miniature adults and stay put. 

219
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:53,104
the hatchery keeps them in suspension in circulating water

220
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,508
so they have an ample supply of food and oxygen.      

221
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,242
as they grow,         

222
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,312
they're transferred      
to progressively larger bottles.

223
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,648
by the time they're four to six weeks old, 

224
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,517
they're ready to leave the hatchery     

225
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,788
and move to the oyster farm.  

226
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,990
the farm floats in a harbor.  

227
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:17,062
the baby oysters arriving are 
a tiny fraction of an inch long.

228
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,397
they go into upwellers.    

229
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,400
pipes circulate seawater,   

230
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:26,004
and the babies filter-feed on the natural phytoplankton. 

231
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,739
over the next six weeks or so, 

232
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:31,910
they quadruple in size to about
2/10 of an inch in length.   

233
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,149
workers then pack them in plastic mesh bags,      

234
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,484
stack the bags on metal racks, 

235
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,354
and suspend the racks in the sea.          

236
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:45,156
the oysters live like that for three months,       

237
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,626
getting transferred into progressively larger mesh bags 

238
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,896
as they grow.         

239
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,031
halfway into it, the oysters are this big --  

240
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,967
about 8/10 of an inch long.  

241
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,770
by the end of three months, they're double this size,   

242
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,772
grown up enough to leave home 

243
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,442
and venture out into the real world.      

244
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,710
workers lay them on the sea floor        

245
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,113
and leave them for six months to reach harvest size,     

246
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,516
which is determined not by length anymore,     

247
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,319
but by weight -- just under three ounces.    

248
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,921
to finally harvest the oysters,

249
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,790
they lower a custom-built machine     

250
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,126
that's part dredger, part conveyer.         

251
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,195
it generates jets of water   

252
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,231
that blow the oysters off the sea bed onto the conveyer. 

253
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,602
they travel up out of the water into the boat.

254
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,675
that conveyer dumps the oysters
onto another conveyer     

255
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,978
that leads to the picking station.    

256
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,615
there, workers select the correct size oysters    

257
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,651
and put them into baskets.   

258
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,625
whatever they leave on the conveyer -- 

259
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,293
smaller oysters, rocks, and such --          

260
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,930
continues to the end and drops back into the water. 

261
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,501
of course, the harvesting machine misses 

262
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,303
some three-ounce oysters.   

263
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,173
those remain on the seabed sometimes for years,      

264
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:12,043
growing larger like this guy, weighing about 2.2 pounds.   

265
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,113
prior to sale, the harvested oysters     

266
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,117
go through a cleaning process called depuration.       

267
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,319
for 42 hours, they sit in tanks

268
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,323
filled with seawater      
sterilized by ultraviolet light.

269
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,126
the oysters draw this     
clean water through their gills.

270
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,795
this flushes out all the bacteria.       

271
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,598
thanks to this depuration process,    

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,867
it's safe to eat raw oysters. 

273
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,402
it's taken a good 18 months  

274
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,806
to grow from microscopic organism to dining delicacy,  

275
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,811
which has a refrigerated shelf life of about a week.  

276
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,227
narrator: long before satellites and doppler radar, 

277
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,096
people relied on weathervanes for storm tracking --     

278
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,699
a folk-art figure balanced on an axis      

279
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,636
turns with the wind to indicate
both its direction and speed. 

280
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,705
though more ornamental than practical,        

281
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,173
it's still a great way to find out    

282
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,375
what's in the wind, weather-wise.         

283
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,381
as it swings with prevailing winds,     

284
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,050
a weathervane offers important clues.    

285
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,521
northeast winds, for example, could mean a storm is brewing. 

286
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:32,257
learn to read the signs, and the weathervane offers   

287
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,392
up-to-the-minute weather information.      

288
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,928
to make a weathervane the old fashioned way,     

289
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,998
a craftsman starts with a sheet of soft copper.  

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,535
it can be easily cut, bent, and shaped.       

291
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,870
using electric shears,     

292
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:48,807
he slices the copper to the appropriate size.    

293
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:52,177
then he clamps it to a steel  
mold of a rooster body and head.

294
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,084
with a rubber mallet, he now carefully pounds the copper   

295
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,685
into the crevasses of the mold.

296
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,221
this is a critical first shaping of the copper,  

297
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,090
and he has to hit it with just the right amount of force.

298
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:10,228
if he's too heavy-handed, he could break or tear the copper.

299
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,563
too little force,       

300
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,699
and the shape won't properly transfer to the metal.     

301
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,102
with a basic rooster shape now established,        

302
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,703
he reaches for an air hammer  

303
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,906
that's equipped with a plastic tip.      

304
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,908
it beats the copper into the mold         

305
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,343
thousands of times per minute. 

306
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,649
this transfers finer details, like feathers.         

307
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,987
and with its smooth plastic tip,

308
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,323
the air hammer inflicts no damage.      

309
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,859
it takes less than 20 minutes, 

310
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,396
and the rooster comes to life in copper.           

311
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,399
he unlocks the clamps     

312
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,034
and removes the molded copper rooster.   

313
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,070
he'll make another one just like it          

314
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,738
for the other side of the weathervane.      

315
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,341
this will distribute its weight correctly      

316
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,910
and make it look good from all angles.        

317
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,015
he then pounds copper into   
the shape of the rooster's tail.

318
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:07,952
it has generous plumage for just the right balance.  

319
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:12,023
with a band saw, he slices around the molded shapes    

320
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:15,760
to remove the excess copper.  

321
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,098
this liberates the molded rooster from the matrix.    

322
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,901
he now trims the rooster with a set of clippers     

323
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,270
to give it a cleaner edge.   

324
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:32,310
using long clippers, he snips copper from inside the beak.  

325
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,312
this opens it up.       

326
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,314
once the ragged bits have been trimmed,       

327
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,582
he's ready to match      

328
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,552
the two sides of this weathervane rooster.  

329
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,723
he secures it in a vise    

330
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:48,727
and cleans the seam with a solution called flux.  

331
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:53,197
he tacks it with solder and then
checks the evenness of the seam.

332
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,467
when the two molds match perfectly,        

333
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,302
he solders the entire seam.  

334
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,141
this weather rooster is now ready for its tail.   

335
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,277
it will give the weathervane a larger surface on one side, 

336
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,879
offering greater resistance to the wind.          

337
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,616
this will cause the front of the weathervane  

338
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,684
to point into the wind.    

339
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,688
he inserts the weathervane axis

340
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,624
through the rooster's foot, into the cavity,        

341
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,495
and it emerges from the back of the neck.   

342
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,365
he pounds the top of the shaft flush to the surface      

343
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:32,170
and then solders it in place for a permanent installation. 

344
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,705
for some extra pizzazz,    

345
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,441
he slides a decorative copper ball up the turning rod,

346
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,911
resting it just below the rooster foot.  

347
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,846
he secures it with solder.   

348
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,718
he now cuts out the feathered end for an arrow.

349
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,186
it's known as the fletching,  

350
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,488
and it will help balance the weathervane.        

351
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,459
he turns the crank of a press 

352
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,529
to roll numerous creases into the fletching.      

353
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,098
the creases mimic feather lines.

354
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,271
he solders the feathered end to the pointed shaft.     

355
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,339
it has a hole for installing it

356
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,742
onto the weathervane's turning rod.          

357
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,812
as the weathervane spins with the prevailing wind,   

358
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,414
the arrow will point in its direction.       

359
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,218
a waddle below the beak and a comb atop his head,   

360
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,555
and this rooster is ready to rule the roof.   

361
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,491
exposure to the elements will weather the copper     

362
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,692
and give it a blue-green patina.

363
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,762
for customers who don't want to wait a few years    

364
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,230
for this to happen,      

365
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:37,501
instant results can be achieved
by applying a special acid.  

366
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,970
depending on its complexity,  

367
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,574
a copper weathervane can take up to two days to build.    

368
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,844
with luck, it could last a century or more.       

369
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:46,978
like the weather,       

370
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,580
predicting a weathervane's long-term viability      

371
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,217
is not an exact science.    

372
