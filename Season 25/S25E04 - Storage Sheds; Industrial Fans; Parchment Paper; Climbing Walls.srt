   discovery communications

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,691
           narrator:            
  today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,588
      throughout history,       
  people have needed a place    

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,856
            to store            
  their personal belongings.    

6
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,459
      early storage sheds       
       were basic huts.         

7
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,462
        today, factories        
produce substantial structures  

8
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,666
  that can be easily assembled  
          from a kit.           

9
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:10,636
    this means finding extra    
             storage            
  space should be no problem.   

10
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,611
 storage sheds provide a home   

11
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:23,616
  for things that don't belong  
     or fit in the house.       

12
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:27,386
    they're made from plastic   
             panels             
  embossed with a wood grain.   

13
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,027
       making one starts        
    with a computer design.     

14
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:39,298
     once they have a plan,     
 machinery rolls into action.   

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,569
   high-density polyethylene    
    plastic flows into a big    
             mixer.             

16
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,572
  some of the plastic pellets   
       are new material,        

17
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,774
   while the rest are pellets   
           recycled             

18
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,841
   from previous processing.    

19
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,445
    this is called regrind.     

20
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,580
       an automated scale       
         measures out           

21
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,048
      the correct amounts       
        of ingredients          

22
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,251
   as they enter the mixer.     

23
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,720
 they add a cooling accelerant  
        and a colorant          

24
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,790
 to the polyethylene pellets.   

25
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,326
    thorough mixing ensures     
    that the final product      

26
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:12,998
     will be evenly colored     
and have structural integrity.  

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,534
 a vacuum pump moves the blend  
       out of the mixer         

28
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:19,605
 and through a network of pipes 
  along the factory ceiling.    

29
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,541
     the pipes deliver the      
 polyethylene mix to a machine  

30
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,411
     called a blow molder.      

31
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,347
  it will blow melted plastic   
    into a two-part mold --     

32
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,917
         in this case,          
      a floor panel mold.       

33
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,756
   the blow molder melts the    
 plastic into a tubular shape.  

34
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:42,228
    the plastic emerges hot     
        and malleable.          

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,799
    in manufacturing lingo,     
    this is call a parasin.     

36
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,034
        the mold closes         
      around the parasin        

37
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,303
    as little needles pierce    
        and inflate it.         

38
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:55,107
 the parasin swells against the 
      walls of the mold,        

39
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,776
       taking its shape.        

40
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:00,246
    the mold embosses a tread   
             design             
          on one side           

41
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:03,449
        and a ridged one        
   on the back for strength.    

42
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:07,720
    a long, automated clamp     
  extracts the hollow panel.    

43
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:11,891
 at this point, the plastic is  
partially cured but still hot.  

44
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,528
         when the panel         
    is ready to be handled,     

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,732
  a team trims the overflow.    

46
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,067
this material is called flash.  

47
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:27,072
   the flash is warm and has    
   a taffy-like consistency.    

48
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,608
   the team leaves it to cool   
          and firm up           

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,878
     before feeding it to a     
            grinder.            

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,481
 the grinding process produces  
 the pellets known as regrind   

51
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:41,019
       that will be used        
     to make more panels.       

52
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,289
   next, the team cuts slots    
           and tabs             

53
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,826
      that will be used for     
           assembling           
 the floor panel to the walls.  

54
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,898
    they stack the panels.      

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,234
      it's quite a pile.        

56
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,738
        they manufacture        
several thousand panels a day.  

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,909
   now, it's over to another    
     blow molding machine.      

58
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,312
 this one creates roof panels,  

59
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,881
            complete            
  with cedar shingle detail.    

60
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,186
    once again, they trim the   
             flash              

61
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,122
        and grind it up         
      to make new panels.       

62
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,059
    very little polyethylene    
        goes to waste.          

63
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:25,197
        the next machine        
       molds door panels        

64
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,533
    with a tongue-and-groove    
        beadboard look.         

65
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,403
    although all of the shed    
             panels             
     are made of plastic,       

66
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,939
    they look like a variety    
         of materials:          

67
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,742
      cedar shakes, siding,     
           beadboard,           

68
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,211
     and even treaded vinyl     
           flooring.            

69
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,286
 a worker randomly pulls panels 
    off the production line     

70
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,888
         for testing.           

71
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,158
 she verifies that the assembly 
   holes are the right size.    

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,027
        she also weighs         
    and measures the panel      

73
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,730
           to confirm           
   it meets specifications.     

74
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,036
 another member of the testing  
 team dabs gel onto the panel   

75
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,639
     in various locations.      

76
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,108
 this gel allows an instrument  
   to measure the thickness     

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,778
        of the plastic.         

78
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,113
    once the panels pass the    
             tests,             

79
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,650
it's time to pack up the kits.  

80
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,519
   there are 15 to 20 panels    
           per kit.             

81
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,928
    employees pack the parts    
         in the order           

82
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,663
that they are to be assembled.  

83
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:38,136
   on the computer, the parts   
   come together in seconds.    

84
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,138
    but in the real world,      

85
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,673
  it takes up to three hours    

86
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,343
        to assemble this        
     plastic storage shed.      

87
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,545
   however, it's a lot easier   
     than building one from     
            scratch.            

88
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,916
   and in the end, you have a   
              place             
       to store things.         

89
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,832
           narrator:            
    industrial fans are extra   
              large   to provid 

90
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,904
       in a large factory       
        or a warehouse.         

91
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:15,040
     they whip up a breeze      
     to keep workers cool,      

92
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,309
      and in the process,       
  they clear the air of dust    

93
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,345
 and other harmful particles.   

94
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,919
   almost 3 feet in diameter    

95
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,254
    and a body tough enough     

96
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,922
      to survive a run-in       
       with a forklift,         

97
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,392
   this is no ordinary fan.     

98
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,995
    it's an industrial fan.     

99
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,597
        they're designed        
    to circulate air in large   
             spaces             

100
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,034
like warehouses and factories.  

101
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,872
       production starts        
        with the motor.         

102
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,276
   a worker slides the fan's    
     aluminum hub onto it.      

103
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:54,212
   then, he inserts wing-like   
   blades known as airfoils     

104
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,282
   into notches in the hub.     

105
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:02,621
   using a hammer, he taps the  
              ends              
    to set them in the hub.     

106
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,890
        he places a part        
     known as a taper lock      

107
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,026
  into a hole in the center.    

108
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:10,162
   the taper lock will fasten   
  the motor shaft to the hub.   

109
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:14,366
       he screws the lip        
    of the lock to the hub.     

110
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:18,070
   he confirms that each screw  
               has              
     been set to the desired    
            torque.             

111
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,709
       next, he installs        
   a blast-reinforced plastic   
              cone              

112
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,645
          on the hub.           

113
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:31,516
   this one secures the ends    
   of the blades in the hub.    

114
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:36,254
 he snaps a cap onto the center 
       of the nose cone.        

115
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,857
  now, he transfers the motor   
       and hub assembly         

116
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,061
       to a mount that's        
 in a heavy-duty plastic ring.  

117
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,666
     he adds an upper mount     
   and screws it to the lower   
              one.              

118
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,706
    this completely encases     
  the motor and hub assembly.   

119
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:04,283
    he trims the outer ring     
     of the fan with rubber     
            molding.            

120
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,086
           the rubber           
 will reduce vibration noise.   

121
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,360
     he lowers a steel yolk     
   onto the plastic surround    

122
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,195
 and attaches it with a screw.  

123
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,633
    he wires a speed control    
  mechanism to the fan motor    

124
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,037
 and fastens it to the outside  
   of the plastic surround.     

125
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,307
      he installs a plate       

126
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,910
   with a control knob on the   
              front             
      of the speed control      
           mechanism.           

127
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,185
 he screws on two metal screens 
      to the fan's yolk.        

128
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:45,190
    this forms a safety cage    
        around the fan.         

129
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,725
        he plugs the fan        
      into a power source       

130
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,895
        and turns it on         
     to test its function.      

131
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,400
           satisfied            
    that it's in good working   
             order,             

132
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,935
    he tightens the screens     
         to the yolk.           

133
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,610
       a two-person crew        
   bolts a wheeled pedestal     

134
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,279
    to the stem of the fan.     

135
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,887
   they set the 108-pound fan   
           upright.             

136
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,358
 it's now ready to circulate.   

137
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,227
        designed to move        
     large volumes of air,      

138
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,962
 this industrial fan generates  

139
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,832
     a considerable breeze      
       inside a factory.        

140
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,438
            to make             
  an industrial ceiling fan,    

141
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,240
         they use long,         
      aluminum airfoils.        

142
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,575
    their wing-like profile     

143
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,244
       will generate lift       
     to produce more air.       

144
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,616
       a punch cuts holes       
  to assemble them to a hub.    

145
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,923
         a worker then          
attaches the main fan assembly  

146
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,191
   to the end of a long post    

147
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,127
            in order            
to facilitate the installation  

148
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,064
     of the long airfoils.      

149
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,534
      he activates a lift       
 that raises the hub assembly,  

150
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,136
   then slides the airfoils     

151
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,705
           onto spars           
  that protrude from the hub.   

152
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,877
        this ceiling fan        
       has 10 airfoils.         

153
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,347
he reinforces the installation  

154
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,018
     with boomerang-shaped      
       metal retainers.         

155
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,486
      high-strength bolts       

156
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,256
      secure the retainers      
  and airfoils to the spars.    

157
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:32,697
  he attaches plastic winglets  
 to the ends of the airfoils.   

158
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,234
  the winglets will direct air  
           downward.            

159
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,206
    he installs a trim ring     
          on the hub.           

160
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,743
  this completes the assembly   
of the industrial ceiling fan.  

161
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,114
    using a remote control,     

162
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,518
     he tests its operation     
   at multiple speed levels.    

163
00:10:54,788 --> 00:11:00,058
    from this vantage point,    
     it seems pretty cool.      

164
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,275
           narrator:            
 lining a cooking or baking pan 

165
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:19,277
    instantly makes cleanup     
      a whole lot easier        

166
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,348
        because nothing         
      sticks to the pan.        

167
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,616
     with parchment paper,      

168
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,151
        there's no need         
       to grease the pan        

169
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,353
   with messy butter or oil.    

170
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,495
 this culinary parchment paper  
comes in a standard sheet roll  

171
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,500
        or an assortment        
     of specialty shapes.       

172
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:45,437
      it's heat resistant       
     to a temperature of 450    
            degrees.            

173
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:53,712
 making paper begins with pulp, 
   which is pulverized wood.    

174
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,780
      this parchment paper      
         manufacturer           

175
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:01,186
  uses eucalyptus because it's  
    a sustainable resource.     

176
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,856
  they mix the pulp with water  
 in a huge, industrial mixer.   

177
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,391
      this special recipe       

178
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,127
      of eucalyptus fibers      
  produces tan-colored paper.   

179
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,331
      once the consistency      
        is just right,          

180
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,801
    they pump the soggy pulp    
      out of the blender        

181
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,403
      and into a machine        

182
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,340
     that spreads it evenly     
   across a metal mesh belt.    

183
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,678
    the water drains through    
   the openings in the mesh.    

184
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,946
     by the time the pulp       

185
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,082
   rolls into the first drum    
     of the next machine,       

186
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,818
          it is formed          
    into a sheet of paper.      

187
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,621
       sprayers rehydrate       
 what's trimmed off the edges   

188
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,691
    so it can be recycled.      

189
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,762
   the paper travels through a  
              long              
    line of heated rollers.     

190
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,065
 they squeeze out the remaining 
   water and dry the paper.     

191
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,238
    a high-resolution scanner   
              looks             
for imperfections as the paper  

192
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,873
      exits the machine.        

193
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,116
    workers unwind the bolt     

194
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:07,719
      and conduct a visual      
           inspection           
     against backlighting.      

195
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,792
   next, the bolt undergoes     

196
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,861
   the first of two critical    
          operations,           

197
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,129
        which transforms        
      this regular paper        

198
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,200
into culinary parchment paper.  

199
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,736
        first, the sheet        
   passes through two baths     

200
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:29,407
        in a proprietary        
     water-based solution.      

201
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,942
  this eliminates air pockets   

202
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,578
          and renders           
   the paper heat-resistant.    

203
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,418
   after a series of rinses,    

204
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,553
       another long line        
       of heated rollers        

205
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,389
  squeezes out the rinse water  
     and dries the paper.       

206
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,298
    the next station sprays     

207
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,968
    both sides of the sheet     
   with food-grade silicone,    

208
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,306
   then bakes on the coating    
     in a gas-fired dryer.      

209
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:05,243
    silicone withstands heat    
     up to 1,500 degrees,       

210
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,445
 so even at the highest cooking 
         temperatures,          

211
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,047
    there will be a barrier     

212
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,650
       that prevents food       
  from sticking to the paper.   

213
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:16,388
  silicone also repels water.   

214
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,256
       this is the paper        
     before the treatments      

215
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:23,061
    make it heat-resistant,     
   nonstick and waterproof.     

216
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,765
    and here's how the paper    
      performs after those      
          treatments.           

217
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,939
    because it's waterproof,    
     you can wet the paper      

218
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,242
  to make it malleable enough   
  to line a pan of any shape.   

219
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,352
   the factory cuts the bolts   
      to consumer widths,       

220
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,421
  then shrink-wraps and ships   
       them to factories        

221
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:52,057
    that supply restaurants     
       and supermarkets.        

222
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,896
    here, machines unwind the   
             bolts,             

223
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,432
   then wind specific lengths   
      of parchment paper        

224
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,833
     onto cardboard tubes.      

225
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:07,772
    winding a 165-foot roll     
   takes just three seconds.    

226
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,308
        the factory also        
 applies its logo to the paper  

227
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,844
     at regular intervals.      

228
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,547
    however, that operation     
        is top-secret.          

229
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,718
    the automated packaging     
 equipment tapes down the edge  

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,388
    to prevent unraveling,      

231
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,259
 then places and seals the roll 
      in a cardboard box.       

232
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:36,201
       the machine stamps       
  the box with a lot code so,   

233
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,669
     if a problem arises,       

234
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,203
the factory can trace the roll  

235
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,174
     back to the large bolt     
   from which it originated.    

236
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,146
     this parchment paper,      
        cardboard tube,         

237
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:52,416
      and box are all made      
  from sustainable resources.   

238
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,954
  the box edge is rigid enough  
     to tear off a sheet,       

239
00:15:55,956 --> 00:16:00,492
   so there's no need for an    
   unrecyclable metal cutting   
             edge.              

240
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,494
         you can throw          
   the used parchment paper     

241
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:06,097
  in your compost bin or rinse  
     off the food remnants      

242
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,835
 and put it along with the box  
   and tube in your recycling   
              bin.              

243
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,917
  narrator: a climbing wall is  
   an artificially constructed  
              wall              

244
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,587
with grips for hands and feet.  

245
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,923
      these walls mimic the     
           experience           
   of outdoor rock climbing     

246
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:35,460
    but in a more controlled    
         environment,           

247
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,529
        allowing people         
   of all ages and abilities    

248
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,764
   the opportunity to climb.    

249
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,670
        a climbing wall         
   can have a flat surface,     

250
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,139
    studded with hand holes     
    that the climber grabs      

251
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,141
         or steps on.           

252
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,477
   or it can be what's called   
        rock-realistic,         

253
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,880
        designed to look        
   like a natural rock wall.    

254
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,083
    that type can also have     
          hand holes,           

255
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:02,353
  or just cracks and fissures   
     like the real thing.       

256
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,221
  the factory builds the wall   
           structure            

257
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,892
   out of thick steel bars.     

258
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,294
workers weld them into frames.  

259
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,496
  each frame will hold a panel  
      that's one portion        

260
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,899
       of the wall face.        

261
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:19,771
   they reinforce the corners   
    of the frame with gusset    
            plates.             

262
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:24,376
 each frame is a distinct size  
          and shape.            

263
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,445
     to make the panels for     
 a flat-surface climbing wall,  

264
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,781
    workers trace the frames    
          on plywood            

265
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,384
         or engineered          
     wood particle board.       

266
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,187
      after spray-painting      
 the corresponding part code,   

267
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,291
    they cut out each panel     
    to match the wall plan.     

268
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,329
  then they screw in t nuts.    

269
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,530
          these nuts            

270
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:51,202
  have a larger-than-standard   
  flange for extra strength.    

271
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,805
       they screw a bolt        
  in the middle of the t nut    

272
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,007
     to protect the threads     
    from the cement finish      

273
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,943
they will spray onto the wood.  

274
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,146
to make a rock-realistic wall,  

275
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:05,884
    they mold cement panels     
to attach to the steel frames.  

276
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:10,889
    to mix the cement, they     
     combine ice and liquid     
            polymer.            

277
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,092
      ice keeps the cement      
from overheating in the mixer.  

278
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,261
    the polymer is a binding    
             agent.             

279
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,230
    it also makes the cement    
           flexible             

280
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,232
          so the wall           
    doesn't crack or chip.      

281
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:28,239
           while they           
  mix the cement ingredients,   

282
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:32,444
  they monitor the temperature  
 with an infrared thermometer.  

283
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,348
     correct temperature is     
            critical            
   for the cement to properly   
              set.              

284
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,253
      they pour the cement      
        through a sieve         

285
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,990
  to filter out large pieces.   

286
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,460
   then, they pump the cement   
       into a spray gun.        

287
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:55,000
  with slow and even strokes,   
     they shoot the cement      

288
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:58,069
      onto a silicone mold      
     of the mountain face.      

289
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,874
     after brushing it into     
the mold's nooks and crannies,  

290
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,810
  they spray two more coats.    

291
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,413
           this time,           
   they simultaneously shoot a  
              gun               

292
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,815
           that chops           
 and sprays fiberglass string   

293
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,717
   to reinforce the cement.     

294
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,627
         they compress          
    the fiberglass-reinforced   
             cement             

295
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,164
          with rollers          
  to even out the thickness.    

296
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,635
 then, they embed rebar loops.  

297
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,439
      rebar is a steel rod      
 used for reinforcing cement.   

298
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,313
  they embed thick, steel rods  
          1 to 2 feet           

299
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,182
   long along the perimeter.    

300
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,988
   then, they let the cement    
        set overnight.          

301
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,794
       the next day, they       
   extract the panel from the   
             mold.              

302
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,798
    a cement panel like this    
     can weigh more than 600    
            pounds.             

303
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,003
  they knock off jagged edges   
         with a mallet          

304
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:09,140
  and check for any weak areas  
    caused by air pockets.      

305
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,276
 after drilling numerous holes  
   for the hand-hold t nuts,    

306
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,479
 they grind the edges smooth.   

307
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:25,023
  they weld the wall panels to  
    their corresponding steel   
             frame              

308
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,659
         and fill gaps          
  between panels with cement.   

309
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,330
     when they're building      
     a flat-surface wall,       

310
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,699
   they spray a cement finish   
         on the wood,           

311
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:38,503
     then a coat of paint.      

312
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:42,106
     once the paint dries,      
  they mount the hand holds.    

313
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,676
          they're made          
    of molded polyurethane.     

314
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,385
   then, they attach the wall   
              panel             
      to the steel frame        

315
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,187
       with a nail gun.         

316
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,394
       flat surface walls       
      are more versatile        

317
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,663
     because they can hold      
        far more t nuts         

318
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,533
  than rock-realistic walls.    

319
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,868
       the more t nuts,         

320
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,603
       the more locations       
        for hand holds.         

321
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,938
      this enables a gym        

322
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,607
   to create a greater range    
      of climbing routes,       

323
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,009
          suiting both          
     experienced climbers       

324
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,146
   and rookie mountaineers.
